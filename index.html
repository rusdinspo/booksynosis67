<h1>BOOK SYNOPSIS & REVIEW</H1><br><a href='https://ebukpdfmobikindele.blogspot.com/'>Source|Download|Full Content</a><h2>Blood Communion: A Tale of Prince Lestat (Vampire Chronicles)</h2><p>In this spellbinding novel, Lestat, rebel outlaw, addresses the tribe of vampires, telling us the mesmerizing story of how he became prince of the vampire world, and of the formation of the Blood Communion, and how his vision for the Children of the Universe to thrive as one, came to be.<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lestat takes us from his ancestral castle in the snow-covered mountains of France to the verdant wilds of lush Louisiana, with its lingering fragrances of magnolias and night jasmine; from the far reaches of the Pacific&#x2019;s untouched islands to the 18th-century city of St. Petersburg and the court of the Empress Catherine. He speaks of his fierce battle of wits and words with the mysterious Rhoshamandes, proud Child of the Millennia, reviled outcast for his senseless slaughter of the legendary ancient vampire Maharet, avowed enemy of Queen Akasha, who refuses to live in harmony at court and who threatens all Lestat has dreamt of . . .</p><p>ANNE RICE is the author of thirty-six books, including the fifteen books in the Vampire Chronicles series. She lives in La Quinta, California.Chapter 1<br><br>I&#x2019;m the vampire Lestat. I&#x2019;m six feet tall, have blue-gray eyes that sometimes appear violet, and a lean athletic build. My hair is blond and thick and hangs to my shoulders, and over the years it has become lighter so that at times it seems pure white. I&#x2019;ve been alive on this earth for more than two hundred fifty years and I am truly immortal, having survived any number of assaults on my person, and my own suicidal recklessness, only becoming stronger as the result.<br><br>My face is square, my mouth full and sensual, my nose insignificant, and I am perhaps one of the most conventional looking of the Undead you&#x2019;ll ever see. Almost all vampires are beautiful. They are picked for their beauty. But I have the boring appeal of a matinee idol rescued by a fierce and engaging expression, and I speak a brand of easy rapid English that&#x2019;s contemporary&#x2014;after two centuries of accepting English as the universal language of the Undead.<br><br>Why am I telling you all this, you might ask&#x2014;you, the members of the Blood Communion, who know me now as the Prince. Am I not the Lestat so vividly described in Louis&#x2019;s florid memoir? Am I not the same Lestat who became a super rock star for a brief time in the 1980s, publicizing the secrets of our tribe in film and song?<br><br>Yes, I am that person, most certainly, perhaps the only vampire known to just about every blood drinker on the planet by name and by sight. Yes, I made those rock videos that revealed our ancient parents, Akasha and Enkil, and how we might all perish if one or both of them were destroyed. Yes, I wrote other books after my autobiography; and yes, I am indeed the Prince now ruling from my Ch�teau in the remote mountains of France.<br><br>But it&#x2019;s been many a year since I addressed you directly, and some of you weren&#x2019;t born when I penned my autobiography. Some of you weren&#x2019;t Born to Darkness until very recently, and some of you might not believe in the story of the Vampire Lestat as it&#x2019;s been related to you&#x2014;or the history of how Lestat became the host to the Sacred Core of all the tribe, and then finally, released from that burden, survived as the ruler upon whom order and survival now depend.<br><br>Make no mistake, the books Prince Lestat and Prince Lestat and the Realms of Atlantis were penned by me, and all that they related has indeed happened, and those many blood drinkers described in the two books are accurately portrayed.<br><br>But the time has come for me once again to address you intimately and to shape this narrative in my own inimitable and informal fashion as I seek to relate to you all that I think you should know.<br><br>And the first thing which I must tell you is that I write now for you&#x2014;for my fellow blood drinkers, the members of the Blood Communion&#x2014;and no one else.<br><br>Of course this book will fall into mortal hands. But it will be perceived as fiction, no matter how obvious it may be that it is not. All the books of the Vampire Chronicles have been received as fiction the world over, and always have been. The few mortals who interact with me in the vicinity of my ancestral home believe me to be an eccentric human who enjoys impersonating a vampire, the leader of a strange cult of like-minded vampire impersonators who gather under my roof to engage in romantic retreats from the busy modern world. This remains our greatest protection, this cynical dismissal of us as real, true monsters, in an era that just might be more dangerous to us than any other through which we&#x2019;ve lived.<br><br>But I will not dwell on the matter in this narrative. The story I&#x2019;m going to tell has little or nothing to do with the modern world. It&#x2019;s a tale as old as tale telling itself, about the struggle of individuals to find and defend their place in a timeless universe, alongside all the other children of the earth and the sun and the moon and the stars.<br><br>But it is important for me to say&#x2014;as this story begins&#x2014;that I was as resentful and confused by my human nature as I&#x2019;d ever been.<br><br>If you do go back to my autobiography, you&#x2019;ll likely see how much I wanted humans to believe in us, how boldly I shaped my narrative as a challenge: Come, fight us, wipe us out! There ran in my Frenchman&#x2019;s blood only one acceptable version of glory: making history among mortal women and men. And as I prepared for my one and only rock concert in San Francisco in the year 1984, I did dream of an immense battle, an apocalyptic confrontation to which elder blood drinkers would be awakened and drawn irresistibly, and young ones incited with fury, and the mortal world committed to stamping out our evil once and for all.<br><br>Well, nothing came of that ambition. Nothing at all. The few brave scientists who insisted they had seen living proof of our existence met with personal ruin, with only a precious few being invited to join our ranks, at which point they passed into the same invisibility which protects us all.<br><br>Over the years, being the rebel and the brat that I am, I created another great sensation, described in my memoir, Memnoch the Devil, and that too did invite mortal scrutiny, a scrutiny which might have seduced yet more hapless individuals to destroy their lives arguing that we were real. But that brief damage to the fabric of the reasonable world was corrected immediately by clever blood drinkers who removed all forensic evidence of us from laboratories in New York City, and within a month all the excitement stirred up by me and my Blessed Veil of Saint Veronica was over, with the relic itself gone to the crypts of the Vatican in Rome. The Talamasca, an ancient Order of Scholars, managed to obtain it after that, and subsequent to their acquiring it, the veil was destroyed. There&#x2019;s a story to all that, a small one anyway, but you won&#x2019;t find it here.<br><br>The point is&#x2014;for all the fuss and bother&#x2014;we remained as safe in the shadows as we&#x2019;d ever been.<br><br>This story&#x2014;to be precise&#x2014;is about how we vampires of the world came together to form what I now call the Blood Communion, and how I came not only to be Prince, but to be the true ruler of the tribe.<br><br>One can assume a title without really accepting it. One can be anointed a prince without reaching for the scepter. One can agree to lead without really believing in the power of oneself to do it. We all know these things to be true.<br><br>And so it was with me. I became Prince because the elders of our tribe wanted me to do it. I possessed something of a charismatic ease with the idea, which others did not share. But I did not really examine what I was doing when I accepted the title, or commit to it. Instead, I clung to a selfish passivity in the matter, assuming that at any moment I might tire of the entire enterprise and walk away. After all, I was still invisible and insignificant, an outcast, a monster, a predatory demon, Cain the slayer of his brothers and sisters, a phantom pilgrim on a spiritual journey so narrowly defined by my vampire existence that whatever I discovered would never be of relevance to anybody, except as poetry, as metaphor, as fiction, and I should take comfort in that fact.<br><br>Oh, I enjoy being the Prince, don&#x2019;t get me wrong. I loved the rapid and totally egregious restoration of my ancestral Ch�teau and the little village which lay below it on the narrow mountain road that led to nowhere&#x2014;and it was an undoubted pleasure to see the great hall filled each evening with preternatural musicians and dancers, flashing exquisite white skin, shimmering hair, costumes of extraordinary richness, and countless jewels. One and all of the Undead were and are now most welcome under my roof. The house has innumerable salons through which you can wander, rooms in which you might settle to watch films on giant flat screens, and libraries in which you might meditate in silence or read. Beneath it are crypts that have been expanded to hold perhaps the entire tribe in darkness and safety, even were the Ch�teau itself attacked in the daylight hours and burnt over our heads.<br><br>I like all this. I like welcoming everyone. I like taking the young fledglings in hand and welcoming them to our closets from which they can take any clothing they need or desire. I like watching them shed their rags and burn them in one of the many fireplaces. I like hearing everywhere around me the soft uneven rumble of preternatural voices in conversation, even argument, and also the low, vibrant rhythm of preternatural thoughts.<br><br>But who am I to rule others? I was anointed the Brat Prince by Marius before I ever set foot on that rock music stage decades ago, and a brat I most surely was. Marius had come up with that little label for me when he realized I was revealing to the Vampire World all the secrets he&#x2019;d bound me under penalty of destruction to keep. And a legion of others have picked up the title, and they use it as easily now as the simple appellation Prince.<br><br>It&#x2019;s no secret to the elders far and wide that I&#x2019;ve never bent the knee to any authority ever, that I smashed up the coven of the Children of Satan when I was taken prisoner by it in the 1700s, and that I broke even the most informal rules with my rock music adventure, and deserved a good deal of the condemnation for recklessness that I received.<br><br>I didn&#x2019;t bow to Memnoch either.<br><br>And I didn&#x2019;t bow to God Incarnate, who appeared to me in the airy spiritual realm into which Memnoch dragged me, all the way back to the narrow dusty road to Calvary in the city of ancient Jerusalem. And having given short shrift to every being who had ever tried to control me, I seemed a most unlikely person to undertake the monarchy of the Undead.<br><br>But as this story begins, I had accepted it. I had accepted it truly and completely and for one simple reason. I wanted us&#x2014;we, the vampires of this world&#x2014;to survive. And I didn&#x2019;t want us clinging to the margins of life, a miserable remnant of bloodsucking vagabonds, battling each other in the wee hours of the night for crowded urban territories, burning out the shelters and refuges of this or that enemy, seeking to destroy one another for the most petty of human or vampiric concerns.<br><br>And that is what we had become before I accepted the throne. That is exactly what we were&#x2014;a parentless tribe, as Benji Mahmoud put it, the little vampire genius who called to the elders of all ages to come forth and take care of their descendants, to bring to us order, and law, and principles for the good of all.<br><br>The good of all.<br><br>It is extremely difficult to do what is good for all when you believe that &#x201c;all&#x201d; are evil, loathsome by their very nature, with no right to breathe the same air as human beings. It is almost impossible to conceive of the welfare of &#x201c;all&#x201d; if one is so consumed with guilt and confusion that life seems little more than an agony except for those overwhelmingly ecstatic moments when one is drinking blood. And that is what most vampires believe.<br><br>Of course I&#x2019;d never bought into the idea that we were evil or loathsome. I&#x2019;d never accepted that we were bad. Yes, I drank blood and I took life, and I caused suffering. But I wrestled continuously with the obvious conditions of my existence, and the bloodlust of my nature, and my great will to survive. I knew full well the evil inherent in humans and I had a simple explanation for it. Evil comes quite simply from what we must do to survive. The entire history of evil in this world is related to what human beings do to one another in order to survive.<br><br>But believing that doesn&#x2019;t mean living it every minute. Conscience is an unreliable entity, at times a stranger to us, then ruling the present moment in torment and pain.<br><br>And wrestling with uneasy conscience, I wrestled as well with my passion for life, my lust for pleasure, for music, and beauty, and comfort and sensuality, and the inexplicable joys of art&#x2014;and the baffling majesty of loving another so much that all the world, it seemed, depended on that love.<br><br>No, I didn&#x2019;t believe we were evil.<br><br>But I&#x2019;d taken on the argot of self-loathing. I&#x2019;d joked about traveling the Devil&#x2019;s Road, and striking like the hand of God. I&#x2019;d used our contempt for ourselves to ease my conscience when I destroyed other blood drinkers; I&#x2019;d used it when I chose cruelty for convenience when other paths had been open to me. I&#x2019;d demeaned and insulted those who didn&#x2019;t know how to be happy. Yes, I was determined to be happy. And I fought furiously for ways to be happy.<br><br>And I had settled&#x2014;without admitting it&#x2014;for the old sacrosanct idea that we were inherently evil and had no place in the world, no right to exist.<br><br>After all, it was Marius himself, the ancient Roman, who had told me we were evil, and that the rational world had no place for evil, that evil could never be effectively integrated into a world which had come to believe in the true value of being good. And who was I to question the great Marius, or realize how lonely his existence was, and how dependent he was on keeping charge of the Core of vampiric life for those whom he so easily branded as evil?<br><br>Whatever my confusion on it, I played no role in a social revolution for blood drinkers. No. It was someone else who questioned the old assumptions about us with a childlike simplicity that changed our world.<br><br>Benji Mahmoud, Born to Darkness at the age of twelve, a Bedouin by birth, was the blood drinker who transformed us all.<br><br>Made by the powerful two-thousand-year-old Marius, Benji had no use for ideas of inherent guilt, mandatory self-hatred, and inevitable mental torment. Philosophy meant nothing to him. Survival was all. And he had another vision&#x2014;that the blood drinkers of the world could be a strong and enduring tribe of immortals, hunters of the night who respected one another and demanded respect in return. And from that simple conviction in Benji&#x2019;s audacious appeal, my monarchy was eventually born.<br><br>And it is only in an informal and carefree style that I can tell you how I eventually came to terms with being the monarch.</p><h2>Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego?: With Fun Facts, Cool Maps, and Seek and Finds for 10 Locations Around the World</h2><p><b>Carmen Sandiego is on a mission to stop VILE, and she needs your help!

Now we&#x2019;re helping her make friends.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My father watches Nat move on to a new project: cutting pictures out of magazines and pasting them to boards. My mom has written &#x201c;happy&#x201d; on one board. Natalie hunts for pictures of people who are happy. There&#x2019;s another board for &#x201c;sad,&#x201d; but Nat doesn&#x2019;t care much about that one.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Look at you, sweet pea. One day you&#x2019;ll find a nice man to marry, and you&#x2019;ll live in your very own house.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My mother doesn&#x2019;t like when my father talks about Nat getting married. She thinks it&#x2019;s more than Natalie will ever manage, but my father says nonsense, his girl can do anything.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dad strokes his bald spot. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll never guess who I drove up top last night.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I don&#x2019;t have to guess. I know. &#x201c;Piper.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Piper is the warden&#x2019;s thirteen-year-old daughter. When I first moved to the island and I was stupid as a stone, I had a crush on her. Now I know better. I hope I do, anyway. Sometimes I get a little turned around by how cute she is.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Piper has a good side . . . but it&#x2019;s tiny and not easy to locate. Dealing with her is like potty-training a snake. Which end does the business? I don&#x2019;t even know.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I take a bite of a crispy corner of my toast. &#x201c;Am I supposed to go before school?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Shouldn&#x2019;t take long.&#x201d; My father glances at the clock. &#x201c;The warden&#x2019;s a busy man. And you, sweet pea.&#x201d; He turns to Natalie. &#x201c;Happy day-before-your-birthday.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Nat doesn&#x2019;t answer.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Things have always been screwy around Natalie&#x2019;s birthday. Every year Mom pretends Natalie is turning ten again, instead of fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, or, this year, seventeen. Mom wants Nat to be younger so she has more time to catch up with the other kids.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>After breakfast, I put on my scratchy shirt and tie, my good trousers and squeaky shoes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When my mom sees me, she takes a step back. &#x201c;Moose! What happened to you?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I shrug. No sense in getting her worked up. If my dad hasn&#x2019;t told her, I&#x2019;m certainly not going to.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Outside, I trudge past the guard tower, which is a tiny room on three-story-tall metal legs. All the firepower on the island is up in the towers and in the gun galleries. An armed guard down with the convicts can be jumped, ambushed, taken down. But when a guard is up high with his gun trained on us, we&#x2019;re all safe. Or as safe as we can be on a twelve-acre rock with kidnappers, con men, hit men, bank robbers, criminals, crooks, murderers, and maybe an assassin or two.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I walk up the steep switchback to the top of the island, which really stinks. Alcatraz is the world&#x2019;s biggest bird toilet; plus there are three hundred and fifty prisoner toilets up here. They don&#x2019;t help the aroma, that&#x2019;s for sure.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The sky directly over the island is a crisp blue, but the fog is rolling through the Golden Gate. Blink once, it&#x2019;s sunny; blink twice and the world has gone gray.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I&#x2019;m in no hurry to see the warden, so I take a detour by the recreation-yard wall.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My dad says the prison yard is a little piece of hell. Things happen there you don&#x2019;t ever want to know about.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The prisoners play baseball here on weekend afternoons. I&#x2019;ve never seen them play, but I&#x2019;ve heard them. One of the cons, a guy named Fastball, who works in the warden&#x2019;s house, made it to the minor leagues before his bank-robbing career got in the way. Another, Fat Fogarty, hits so hard, he&#x2019;s broken two bats.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It&#x2019;s scary that they give baseball bats to felons, but I guess baseball can make any guy behave. My father says baseball is as important inside the prison as it is outside it. He says the prison-game scores get posted right next to the major league scores on the menu every week.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I keep walking past the cell house, where a con is shouting about a hanging tree. I&#x2019;ve never been inside the main part of the cell house, and I sure don&#x2019;t want to go in there, either.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Since a convict stabbed my father a few months ago, I haven&#x2019;t thought it was so great to live on an island with a bunch of murderers . . . especially with a sister like Natalie.</p></p><h2>Gyoza: The Ultimate Dumpling Cookbook: 50 Recipes from Tokyo&#39;s Gyoza King - Pot Stickers, Dumplings, Spring Rolls and More!</h2><p><b>Whether eaten in an exclusive restaurant or at a humble street stall, gyoza dumplings are the ultimate Asian comfort food. </b> <br><br>Dumplings are surprisingly easy to make once you learn a few basic techniques.

I remember Sugar Ray Robinson, then the welterweight champion, stopping his flashy Cadillac on our block and sparring with me and the other kids. All the kids on the block loved his playing with us, even the girls. Once in a while I would spot heavyweight champ Joe Louis on 125th Street near the Apollo Theater in New York City and that was always a thrill. But Robinson and Louis were relatively simple men, their brilliance limited to their exploits in the ring. Another Robinson, Jackie, had just integrated major league baseball and became, for me, the most exciting male figure in the African-American community until the Summer Olympics of 1960.That summer, a young man would stand on the podium, a gold medal around his neck, while the &#x201c;Star Spangled Banner&#x201d; played. A caption on the television I watched announced that Cassius Clay had won the gold medal in boxing. It was the first glimpse for most Americans of the man who would come to be known as The Greatest.</p><h2>Winter Dance Board Book: A Winter and Holiday Book for Kids</h2><p><b>Now in a lush gift board book edition perfect for those snuggly storytimes!

This is her first picture book.K-Gr 2&#x2014;In this galactic retelling of the beloved children's story, Cinderella has a knack for repair. With the help of her sidekick, a robotic mouse named Murgatroyd, she tinkers with her stepmother's household appliances, but dreams of repairing spaceships. When an invitation to the Prince's Royal Space Parade arrives, the evil stepmother and her daughters leave Cinderella stranded, zooming into space with her toolbox. With the help of her fairy godrobot, Cinderella fixes a broken rocket and then dons a bejeweled atomic blue space suit, to race across the "starry sky" and join the crowds at the parade. When the royal ship has engine trouble, Interstellar Cinderella comes to the rescue. The grateful prince whisks her away to the Gravity Free Ball. At midnight, Cinderella has to run away, but the couple is reunited when the prince searches the cosmos for her. In a modern twist, Cinderella rejects his marriage proposal, but agrees to become his chief mechanic. The rhyming text is accompanied by somewhat jumbled illustrations painted in shadowy browns, greens, and blues. Cinderella resembles a Disney princess with her wide eyes, red hair and determined expression. The appropriately themed endpapers showcase an array of her space-age tools and gadgets.

She lives in upstate New York with her husband, Harry, three horses, and one grandcat.chapter one<br>THUNDER EGG<br>On the first day of summer, Jesse, his cousin Daisy, and his uncle Joe went to High Peak. Uncle Joe had come to look for rocks. Jesse and Daisy had mostly come for the ride. Upon reaching the windy summit of High Peak, Jesse took one look at the view and bent over to pick up a rock. It made him feel dizzy to look down from the mountain, which was doing a pretty good job of living up to its name. Besides, maybe the rock would actually weigh him down enough to keep him from blowing away.<br>From Goldmine City (a big name for a small town), High Peak was sometimes visible. It rose in the distance like a delicious dessert topped with whipped cream. The whipped cream was snow, which was always there, even on the hottest day of the year.<br>Jesse was on the mountain for the first time. Uplose, the snow didn&#x2019;t look so good. It looked sort of crusty and dirty, and it was much colder on the mountaintop than it was down in Goldmine City. Jesse&#x2019;s sweatshirt was not doing much to keep him warm.<br>Jesse had been living in Goldmine City with Daisy, Uncle Joe, and Aunt Maggie since Easter vacation in March. His parents were in Africa, setting up a children&#x2019;s clinic in a village in Tanzania. Jesse had traveled with his parents his whole life, but on his tenth birthday he decided that he wanted to live in America. He wanted to eat American food, go to an American school, and have adventures with Daisy, his favorite cousin, who he had been visiting for three weeks every summer of every year of his life.<br>These days, Jesse wore two watches on his left wrist, one with a blue band and one with a black band. The watch with the black band told him the time in Goldmine City. The watch with the blue band told him the time in Tanzania. It was two o&#x2019;clock here and midnight there. He imagined his parents asleep beneath mosquito netting in their hut, surrounded by snakes as long as cars and bugs as big as chipmunks. On the whole, even given the extreme elevation, he was happier here with Daisy.<br>Jesse went over to where Daisy was sitting to find out what she was doing. Anyone seeing them together would think they were friends rather than family, because they looked nothing alike. They were both ten years old, but Jesse was small for his age and sturdy, with brown eyes and shaggy brown hair. Daisy was fair-haired and tall and thin. The wind whipped her hair, which was as pale and fine as corn silk. The tips of her ears, which poked through her hair like an elf &#x2019;s, were bright pink. The tip of her nose matched.<br>Daisy looked up and smiled at Jesse through lips blue with cold. Then she went back to sketching a flower that was poking out of the snow. Her pencil was sticking out of the sleeve of her sweatshirt, which she had pulled over her hand to keep it warm. A wildflower handbook was open, its pages weighted down at the edges with small stones. Her eyes went from flower to sketch to handbook and back again. What rocks were for her father, flowers were for Daisy. She liked to say: &#x201c;Not knowing the names of the flowers is like not knowing the names of your own brothers and sisters.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What kind is it?&#x201d; Jesse asked.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m pretty sure it&#x2019;s <i>Prunella vulgaris,</i>&#x201d; she said.<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s totally magical. Its folk name is self-heal.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Cool,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;What does it heal?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;The Indians used to put it on boils,&#x201d; she said.<br>&#x201c;Boils. Gross,&#x201d; he said.<br>Daisy carefully picked the wildflower and laid it between the pages of her notebook, right next to her sketch. She printed the name in neat block letters beneath the sketch and then turned the page. At home, she would transfer the specimen to her wildflower press, and, when it was dried, she would frame it. She had over twenty varieties of wildflowers already framed, her contribution to their Museum of Magic. The two cousins&#x2019; way of keeping in touch over the years had been by reading the same books of fantasy. They were convinced that sooner or later they would have a magical adventure of their own. While they waited, they saw magic in everything around them: in flowers and seashells, in birds and animals, even in old bottles and doorknobs.<br>Daisy gave Jesse a sidelong look. &#x201c;You okay?&#x201d; she asked. She knew about his fear of heights. On the hike up the mountain, she had stopped practically every tenth step to ask him the same question.<br>Jesse nodded and held up the rock to show her that he was keeping busy, but Daisy had already moved on to the next wildflower. Jesse closed his eyes and thought about the e-mail message he would write to his parents when he got back to the house:<br>Dear Mom and Dad, I finally got to High Peak. It is pretty high for an old volcano. But it is frozen stiff now. The snow looks sort of like whipped cream&#x2013;<br>Jesse stopped cold.<br><i>&#x201c;Let me out!&#x201d;<br></i>Jesse&#x2019;s eyes snapped open. The voice sounded close and far away at the same time, like the music leaking out of somebody else&#x2019;s earphones. Jesse looked around. Daisy and Uncle Joe were the only other people on the mountaintop. Uncle Joe was bending over, tapping a boulder with a small pickax. Daisy was flipping back and forth through her handbook. Then Jesse saw a man standing not far away. The man was poking around with a stick, the tail of his long black coat trailing in the snow. He was a bit strange-looking, but he clearly wasn&#x2019;t calling to Jesse.<br><i>&#x201c;Jesse!&#x201d;<br></i>There it was again!<br><i>&#x201c;Jesseeee! Let. Me. Out!&#x201d;<br></i>Jesse looked down. Either he was going crazy or the voice was coming from the rock in his hand. He held it up to his ear.<br><i>&#x201c;Let! Me! Out!&#x201d; </i>said the rock. Or was the voice coming from something <i>inside </i>the rock?<br>Jesse held the rock at arm&#x2019;s length and stared atit. Uncle Joe liked to say: &#x201c;If you see a rock that talks to you, pick it up and bring it home.&#x201d; Jesse had always been pretty sure that Uncle Joe did not mean this for real. But now he wondered. The rock looked ordinary. It was round and nubby, the color of oatmeal with blackberry bits in it, including the green leafy part. It was warm from the sun and fit his hand like a softball.<br><i>&#x201c;Jesse. Tiger!&#x201d; </i>said the rock.<br>&#x201c;Huh? What did you say?&#x201d; he whispered to the rock. Almost no one knew that Jesse&#x2019;s middle name was Tiger.<br><i>&#x201c;Jesse! Tiger!!&#x201d; </i>said the rock again, vibrating in Jesse&#x2019;s hand.<br>&#x201c;Daze?&#x201d; he called out to his cousin, holding the rock up over his head. &#x201c;This rock&#x2013;&#x201d; He stopped. He didn&#x2019;t know quite how to put it. He didn&#x2019;t want her to think that his fear of heights had made him wacky or anything.<br><i>Then again, maybe that&#x2019;s exactly what&#x2019;s happening, </i>he thought.<i><br></i>Daisy took one look at the rock, then leaped up and ran over to him. She did a dance, like a happy little prospector who had just struck gold. &#x201c;Jesse!&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;You found one! A thunder egg!&#x201d; She pounded him on the back.<br>Uncle Joe was always talking about thunder eggs. There were lots of them in the area. They were also called geodes, and they were filled with agate. When you cracked one open, there were beautiful crystals inside.<br>&#x201c;Do thunder eggs talk?&#x201d; Jesse asked, trying to make his question sound like a joke.<br>Daisy grinned at him and gave him a playful shove. &#x201c;Sure they do. This one&#x2019;s saying, &#x2018;Take me home, Jesse. Take me home and open me up.&#x2019; Come on. Let&#x2019;s show my pops.&#x201d;<br>She dragged Jesse over to Uncle Joe. &#x201c;Poppy, look what Jesse just found.&#x201d;<br>When Uncle Joe saw Jesse&#x2019;s rock, he straightened up. Then he took off his cap and tugged his long, graying ponytail. His cap was purple, with the words ROCK STAR inscribed in orange letters on the bill. It was a pretty funny joke, if you were a geologist like Uncle Joe.<br>&#x201c;Sure looks like a geode to me,&#x201d; said Uncle Joe. &#x201c;Congratulations, Jesse. She&#x2019;s a beauty.&#x201d;<br>Jesse squinted up at his uncle. &#x201c;How do you know it&#x2019;s a girl?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Because,&#x201d; said Uncle Joe with a wink, &#x201c;I speak the secret language of rocks.&#x201d;<br><i>Then how come this rock is talking to </i>me <i>instead of to you? </i>Jesse wanted to ask. But he didn&#x2019;t say<i> </i>anything. Instead, he wrapped the thunder egg in a<i> </i>clean blue bandanna and gently placed it in the<i> </i>pouch of his sweatshirt.<i><br></i>&#x201c;Okay, guys!&#x201d; said Uncle Joe. He put his cap back on. &#x201c;I think we can call it a day here. Let&#x2019;s head back down and take Jesse&#x2019;s thunder egg to the Rock Shop.&#x201d;<br>As they made their way across the summit back to the hiking path, they passed the strange man in the black coat, who stopped poking with his stick and stared at them as they went by. The sunlight glinting off his round wire-rim glasses made him look eerily as if he didn&#x2019;t have any eyes. Jesse quickly looked away. In the pouch of his sweatshirt, the thunder egg zapped him so hard he yelped.<br>Daisy turned and gave him a look. &#x201c;Are you <i>sure </i>you&#x2019;re okay?&#x201d;<i><br></i>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m fine!&#x201d; he said, his face burning.<br>The Rock Shop was an old garden shed behind the house. It had a worktable, shelves for Uncle Joe&#x2019;s rocks, filing cabinets for his notes, and all the tools of his trade, including a special one for cutting open a thunder egg.<br>Uncle Joe had cut open thousands of thunder eggs in his life but he still got a kick out of doing it. He put on his goggles and heavy work gloves before picking up his big band saw. Jesse wasn&#x2019;t convinced that cutting open the rock was the right thing to do. What if doing that hurt whatever was inside? He covered his mouth, pretending to stifle a yawn as he whispered to the thunder egg, &#x201c;Are you okay with this?&#x201d;<br>The thunder egg vibrated warmly in his hand. Jesse decided to take that as a yes.<br>Jesse was still hesitant to hand the rock over to his uncle. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll be careful, won&#x2019;t you?&#x201d; Jesse said. &#x201c;I mean, this won&#x2019;t, um, hurt or damage the crystals inside, will it?&#x201d;<br>Uncle Joe smiled kindly. &#x201c;I won&#x2019;t harm a single one of them. I promise.&#x201d; He held out a gloved hand.<br>Daisy gave her cousin a gentle shove. &#x201c;Come on, Jessie Tiger. Let&#x2019;s get a look at those crystals.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Goggles first, guys,&#x201d; Uncle Joe said.<br>Daisy went to a shelf and got two pairs of goggles. She tossed a pair to Jesse. Jesse almost dropped them, because just then the rock hissed, <i>&#x201c;Jesssss&#x2013;Jesssss&#x2013;Jesssss&#x2013;Jesssss.&#x201d;</i><br>Jesse&#x2019;s glance slid from Daisy to Uncle Joe. Neither one of them seemed to have heard the rock. Arm trembling, Jesse handed the thunder egg to Uncle Joe. He winced as his uncle set down the saw and placed the rock between the iron jaws of a vise. He winced again as Uncle Joe spun the bolt and tightened the jaws around the thunder egg.<br>&#x201c;Stand back, guys,&#x201d; said Uncle Joe.<br>Jesse and Daisy took one step away from him. Uncle Joe picked up the saw and turned on the motor. It roared to life, vibrating mightily. Then Uncle Joe put the whirring blade to the top of the rock.<br><i>&#x201c;Wait!&#x201d; </i>Jesse hollered over the noise of the machine.<br>Uncle Joe looked up. He switched off the saw and pushed up his goggles. &#x201c;What is it, Jesse?&#x201d; he asked.<br>Jesse faltered. &#x201c;It seems like a pretty delicate thing,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I really, really, <i>really </i>don&#x2019;t want to hurt it.&#x201d;<br>Daisy rolled her eyes. &#x201c;Poppy&#x2019;s only cut open a million rocks. I think he knows what he&#x2019;s doing, Jesse. <i>Really.</i>&#x201d;<br>Uncle Joe spoke very calmly. &#x201c;How about this? How about if I use the machine to cut a shallow groove in the rock? Then I&#x2019;ll turn it off and we can crack it open the rest of the way, carefully and gently, with a small chisel and a soft mallet.&#x201d;<br>Jesse&#x2019;s chest heaved with relief. He nodded gratefully. &#x201c;Thanks, Uncle Joe. That sounds good.&#x201d; <br>Uncle Joe smiled at Jesse. &#x201c;Okay if I switch on the saw?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Sure,&#x201d; said Jesse. &#x201c;Go ahead.&#x201d; But he regretted this decision as soon as he heard the rock scream again above the noise of the saw. Just as Jesse was about to lunge over to Uncle Joe, the saw coughed and made a crackling sound.<br>Uncle Joe switched it off. &#x201c;Well, I&#x2019;ll be,&#x201d; he said, holding up the saw so Jesse and Daisy could see it. The blade had split in two. Jesse and Daisy stepped toward the worktable. The egg wasn&#x2019;t even nicked.</p><h2>Haunted America</h2><p>This 272-page, 1-color book will answer your burning questions about ghosts...you know, the ones you've been dying to ask but were too afraid to.<br>Haunted America carefully blends historical facts with terrifying tales of true hauntings, strange stories of unexplained events, and bizarre bits of paranormal phenomena that are sure to make a believer out of the staunchest skeptics.<br>Learn how the testimony of a ghost got a man convicted of murder.

He didn&#x2019;t mean to hurt anyone, he didn&#x2019;t mean to unlock his destiny, and he certainly didn&#x2019;t mean to see the shadows. But that is exactly what happened. Life often came at Will while he was focused on something else.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Since Will was twelve and nearly five feet tall, his parents thought he had outgrown riding the donkey they had rented for his brother Leo&#x2019;s birthday.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Aren&#x2019;t you a little old for a donkey ride, Will? It&#x2019;s for the kids. C&#x2019;mon,&#x201d; Deborah Wilder said, playfully mussing his spiky black hair in their sweltering backyard. She had a thin face like Will&#x2019;s, full lips, and blue-purple eyes that even the hardest of hearts could not resist for long. It was no wonder her TV show, Supernatural Secrets, had so many fans. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re getting so big, the donkey could ride you! Why don&#x2019;t you and your friends go finish that catapult thing you&#x2019;ve been working on?&#x201d; She gave him a quick one-armed hug and made her way back toward the party guests.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Mom, please, just one time around the yard--or maybe down the block,&#x201d; Will begged.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;No, you&#x2019;ll kill it, you big ox!&#x201d; she said over her shoulder with a smirk. Deborah swept back her straight brown hair and bent down to fix Will&#x2019;s six-year-old sister Marin&#x2019;s pink dress.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;So now donkey rides have age restrictions?&#x201d; Will yelled after her. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t know that, Mom! Is there a height limit too?&#x201d; But Deborah Wilder paid him no attention. She had already mingled back into the crush of family, children, and neighbors in the fun part of the yard.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Marin stuck her tiny pink tongue out at Will, both hands on her hips. &#x201c;Follow the rules, mithter. Follow the rules,&#x201d; she scolded with a lisp before cartwheeling away.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Sulking in defeat, Will shuffled back toward his three friends, two boys and a girl, who were watching closely from the fence at the rear of the yard. Since when am I too big? Will believed he had at least another year, maybe two, before he would officially outgrow amusements like donkey rides. He knew he had to let them go eventually. But not now--especially when money and prestige were on the line.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Strike one, Will-man,&#x201d; Andrew Stout, a massive kid with blazing red hair, and one of Will&#x2019;s closest friends, bellowed. &#x201c;Where&#x2019;s my five dollars?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not finished yet,&#x201d; Will said.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, no. You&#x2019;re finished. I said you couldn&#x2019;t get on the donkey, and you ain&#x2019;t on the donkey. So pay up. If you want to try again, it&#x2019;ll be double or nothing.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Can we check the law on this?&#x201d; interrupted a rail-thin boy with eyes that looked like black BBs behind his rectangular glasses. Simon Blabbingdale lightly poked Andrew&#x2019;s side with one of the thick paperbacks he always seemed to be carrying. &#x201c;Is it legal for Sheriff Stout&#x2019;s adolescent son to bet on ponies at a birthday party?&#x201d; Simon unleashed a series of high-pitched snorts, which he considered laughter. Nobody joined him. Simon and Will had been friends since the first grade. When no one in the cafeteria would sit next to the scrawny, curly-haired kid with glasses, Will did.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Can it, Simon.&#x201d; Andrew flicked the paperback from his ribs and focused on Will. &#x201c;We made a deal, Will-man, so pay up. I need the money for our trip.&#x201d; The big kid extended his open palm.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Wilders had invited Andrew and Simon to join them in Florida at the National Pee-Wee Karate Championships. Leo, an accomplished brown belt, was to compete at the tournament in two weeks&#x2019; time. Will and his friends would tag along for moral support and hit a few amusement parks between matches.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;What if I told you that I just came up with a new way to get on the donkey?&#x201d; Will mysteriously threw out, his hands clasped behind his back.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s see it. Double or nothing,&#x201d; Andrew said.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Camilla Meriwether, a girl with wide green eyes, a long chestnut-colored ponytail, and braces, rapped her knuckles on the fence behind her. &#x201c;Guys. Can we please try to act a little more mature? I mean, it&#x2019;s embarrassing. If Will&#x2019;s parents don&#x2019;t want him riding the donkey, why can&#x2019;t we just have some cake and enjoy the party?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Andrew and Will eyeballed each other, then in unison turned to Cami. &#x201c;Uh, no.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Cami was the only girl Will spoke to in his entire class. She was kind, sort of cute, and always spoke her mind--even if he rarely listened to her. &#x201c;Okay, well, while you little guys play your cowboy games, I&#x2019;m going to get some punch.&#x201d; She marched over to one of the refreshment tables.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When Cami was out ofearshot, Andrew spoke up. &#x201c;All right, get onto the donkey&#x2019;s back, I&#x2019;ll give you ten bucks. If you don&#x2019;t, you have to pay up. Deal?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Will furrowed his brow and got in Andrew&#x2019;s face. &#x201c;Deal.&#x201d; They shook on it and Will started to leave, but a swift tap on the arm from Simon stopped him.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I was thinking, as long as everybody&#x2019;s making wagers,&#x201d; Simon said, looking over the top of his glasses, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll buy you the first souvenir of our trip--no more than five dollars--if you race the donkey around the yard. You can&#x2019;t just ride it. I&#x2019;m talking a full gallop. If there&#x2019;s no gallop, you pick up the souvenir.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Will considered the offer for barely a second. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to be ten dollars richer and score a free souvenir. You&#x2019;re on too.&#x201d; He shot the boys a crooked smile, then ran off to appeal the donkey ban to the authority of last resort.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dan Wilder, Will&#x2019;s father, with his tortoiseshell glasses and blue apron, stood at the barbecue pit on the deck methodically tending his perfectly spaced burgers. He laid them out like houses on a map at one of his city planning meetings. Dan Wilder was an architect, a city councilman, and a planner for the town of Perilous Falls. He had a refined sense of order even when it came to grilling--patties were restricted to the lower grill, veggies on the top.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As dads went, Dan was a handsome one. He had a strong, square jaw, and aside from three slight scars on the left side of his face, Dan could have been on the cover of any grocery checkout aisle magazine. A dad of few words, he usually kept to himself, attentively watching while others chattered on. Indeed, he had overheard Will&#x2019;s donkey pleas all day by the time the boy made his approach.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Dad, I was wondering . . .&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Without looking up from the smoldering patty at the end of his spatula, Mr. Wilder announced, &#x201c;The answer . . . son . . . is no.&#x201d; Then, brightening, he added, &#x201c;Do you want a burger?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Unless it can ride me around the yard, no thanks.&#x201d; Will stalked away in a huff to plot his next move.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He climbed onto a picnic table close to his house and studied the landscape like a general planning an invasion. How to get on that donkey?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>On the opposite side of his yard stood the squinty-eyed, mustached Heinrich Crinshaw. The Wilders&#x2019; bow-tied next-door neighbor was chairman of the Perilous Falls City Council and a constant if disagreeable presence at family events. On the surface Mr. Crinshaw seemed a refined gentleman, even warm.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Until he opened his mouth.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In a flat drone, he advised the neighborhood kids to stay on the Wilders&#x2019; side of the fence, worried that they might leap into his garden and ruin the rare flowers and herbs he spent thousands of dollars maintaining.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s nothing over there for you,&#x201d; he croaked to the kids when their parents were out of earshot. Then, bending down to their level, with a smile he added, &#x201c;Though my dog, Suzy, might like to see you all. She so enjoys children. She ate two last year--bones and all.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Mr. Crinshaw turned away as a couple of the little girls immediately burst into tears.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Will spied Aunt Freda, Deborah Wilder&#x2019;s blond relative, who had made herself snack guardian. Looking like an albino elephant caught in a kelly-green bedsheet, Freda jealously protected the table from approaching guests, gobbling cheese squares and chips as she made her way toward the cake at the other end of the table.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Across from Aunt Freda, near the drink station, Mayor Ava Lynch held a circle of parents spellbound. Her red suit and helmet of hard black hair seemed out of place at a backyard summer party. With the help of some sort of greasy youth cream, her skeletal face was quite animated that day. &#x201c;No, no . . . this city has got to move beyond the shackles of its history or we will never grow,&#x201d; she brayed, as if giving a campaign speech. At nearly seventy years old, the mayor&#x2019;s booming voice could still fill a yard, even reaching Will. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s why I decided to cancel this year&#x2019;s Jacob Wilder Day celebrations. The world is changing, and it is high time Perilous Fallsevolves with it. We can&#x2019;t pretend we&#x2019;re in the era of Jacob Wilder anymore,&#x201d; she said, chuckling.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Will saw his great-aunt Lucille Wilder&#x2019;s face flush with color at the mention of Jacob Wilder. Fireworks were coming. The compact woman with strawberry-blond hair spun on her heels to face the mayor.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Who are you to cancel a forty-five-year tradition?&#x201d; Aunt Lucille asked in a sharp voice, her curls trembling as if to emphasize the point. &#x201c;My father gave his life for this town, and I&#x2019;ll be stewed if you are going to stamp out his memory. Find another punching bag for your campaign, Ava--preferably someone living. You should all remember,there would be no Perilous Falls were it not for my father, Jacob Wilder.&#x201d; Those watching the little woman with fire in her arresting blue eyes fell silent.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, Lucille. You have to admit that your father&#x2019;s superstitious tales were wearing thin even when we were children. All that devil stuff . . .&#x201d; Mayor Lynch laughed, trying to win over the crowd. &#x201c;I know that your father founded the town--and it is wonderful that you run his little museum, bless your heart--but those antique trinkets and allyour daddy&#x2019;s stories won&#x2019;t make a safe and prosperous future for Perilous Falls. We&#x2019;re in the twenty-first century now, honey. People no longer believe the things our parents did. And we just don&#x2019;t have the resources to celebrate old fables, or even the one who created them.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The red hue of Aunt Lucille&#x2019;s face clashed with the powder-blue silk pantsuit she wore. Like loose pajamas, the material swallowed up Lucille&#x2019;s trim frame--but not her hands, which had balled into fists.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Your eyes see nothing, Ava, dear. They never did. My father was a visionary who had courage and virtues you&#x2019;ve never possessed. If you don&#x2019;t agree with his beliefs, or his warnings, say so. But don&#x2019;t disparage a man you never knew. Without my family, you might still be seating customers at Belle&#x2019;s Lounge.&#x201d; Lucille stared holes into the mayor. &#x201c;My grandfather Abe opened his first iron ore mine here when it was nothing but wilderness. My father tamed that wilderness with a purpose. He established schools and churches, and the city hall that you profane. He always said Perilous Falls was to be the last stronghold against the dark madness of the world. Our faith and our traditions are what sustain this town, Ms. Mayor. It is who we are. It is who we will always be. That is the legacy of Jacob Wilder, and I will celebrate him with or without mayoral approval. Now, if you&#x2019;ll excuse me.&#x201d; Aunt Lucille turned a withering glance on the mayor and bolted toward the house.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Poor woman&#x2019;s lost her mind,&#x201d; Mayor Lynch whispered to those nearest her.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Though in her sixty-sixth year, Aunt Lucille looked far younger as she strode across the yard with the ease and grace of a powerful dancer. She stopped next to Will&#x2019;s mom, throwing an arm dramatically on her shoulder.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Deb, dear, I totally forgot that I have a physical therapy session today,&#x201d; Aunt Lucille said. &#x201c;I left my gift for Leo on the kitchen table. Tell him I want to see his new karate moves and take him out on the boat one day this week, just him and me.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Did Ava say something?&#x201d; Deborah asked, suddenly serious. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t leave. Why don&#x2019;t you two try to settle your differences?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Deceit and lies are differences to be avoided, not settled. Ava Lynch&#x2019;s lies have done enough damage to this family . . . ,&#x201d; Aunt Lucille said darkly, shoving both hands into her brocaded silken pockets. Then, smiling, she added, &#x201c;I would love to stay for the rest of the party, but my physical therapy is so important these days. Let&#x2019;s talk later, dear.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Catching sight of Will on the picnic table as she reached the kitchen door, she threw him an exaggerated kiss and, her finger bouncing as if striking a note on an invisible piano, silently mouthed, &#x201c;You--be--good.&#x201d; With a wave, she was gone in a flash of blue silk.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Deborah followed Aunt Lucille to the center of the yard and announced, &#x201c;There&#x2019;s only one more donkey ride to go before we eat. It&#x2019;s the birthday boy&#x2019;s turn!&#x201d; She motioned for her younger son to come forward.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Mom, I don&#x2019;t need a commercial.&#x201d; The eight-year-old with the pouty lips and glasses rolled his eyes. Leo reluctantly edged past his friends toward a jumpy donkey leashed to an old bearded fellow.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;You ride as long as you want,&#x201d; Mrs. Wilder cooed to the red-faced Leo. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s your day. You&#x2019;re the boss.&#x201d; She returned to filling cups with punch and ordered Mr. Wilder to start doling out his precious hamburgers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>From the fence Andrew snapped a ten-dollar bill over his head, nodding knowingly at Will. Simon rotated his hands in a circular motion to spur Will to action.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Feeling the pressure, Will glared at Leo riding the donkey in lazy rings. He struggled to devise some way onto the animal&#x2019;s back.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Just then, something out of the corner of Will&#x2019;s eye drew his attention. A hunched black form crept into the very edge of his vision, sending a chill through his body. The air suddenly reeked, and his nose tingled. Will was afraid to look directly at the form, but he could feel its menace. Given its size, it could have been a crouching bear or even an ogre from one of his kiddie books. But when he mustered the courage to turn his head to face it, he saw nothing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Shadows and &#x201c;fuzzy things&#x201d; appearing in his peripheral vision had been an ongoing problem for Will since he was at least four years old. He had seen them at school, down near the Perilous River, even at friends&#x2019; houses. His mother had repeatedly taken him to the eye doctor to diagnose the problem.

He describes his younger self as a classic second-stringer: &#x201c;I was too slow and too short for basketball; I was too small for football, a little too chicken to hang in there against the best fastballs. So, by my senior year the only sport I was still playing was golf.&#x201d; He was a teacher for many years in the Seattle area, where he now lives with his wife.<br><br> carldeuker.ag-sites.net/bio.htm</p>My earliest memory is of an afternoon in June. I was four years old, and I was in the backyard with my dad. He&#x2019;d just bought me a purple and gold mini football, my first football. He&#x2019;d marked off an area of our backyard with a white chalk line. Here&#x2019;s how it works, Mick. You try to run there,&#x201d; he said, pointing behind the line, and I try to stop you.&#x201d; He shoved the mini football into the crook of my arm, led me to the far end of the yard, went back to the middle, got down on his knees, and yelled: Go!&#x201d;<br><br>I took off running toward the end zone. Our backyard is narrow, his arms are long, and even on his knees he could move fast enough to catch a four-year-old. Time after time I ran, trying to get by him. But he never let me have anything for nothing, not even then. Over and over he&#x2019;d stretch out one of his arms and tackle me. Sometimes the tears would well up. There&#x2019;s no crying in football,&#x201d; he&#x2019;d say, which I guess is a joke from some Tom Hanks movie, and he&#x2019;d send me back to try again.<br><br>And then I did it. I zigged when he was expecting a zag, and I was by him. I crossed the chalk line at the end of the yard, my heart pounding. I remember squealing for joy as I turned around. He was lying on the ground, arms reaching toward me, a huge smile on his face. Touchdown Mick Johnson!&#x201d; he yelled. Your first touchdown!&#x201d;<br><br>All those years, I believed that every kid in the neighborhood was jealous of me. And why not? I&#x2019;d spent time at the houses of the boys on my block Philip and Cory and Marcus. I&#x2019;d seen their dads sprawled out on the sofa. Mostly they&#x2019;d ignore me, but if they asked me something, it was always about school. I&#x2019;d answer, and then they&#x2019;d go back to their newspaper. These fathers drove delivery trucks or taught high school or worked in office buildings in downtown Seattle. They wore glasses, had close-cropped hair, and either had bellies or were starting to get them. Everything about them seemed puny.<br><br>My dad was bigger and stronger than any of them. His voice was deeper, his smile wider, his laugh louder. Like me, he has red hair, only his was long and reached his shoulders. He wore muscle T-shirts that showed his tattoos on one shoulder a dragon, on the other a snake. He kept a keg of beer in the den, and whenever he filled his beer stein, he&#x2019;d let me sip the foam off the top. The way he looked, the way he acted those things alone put him a million miles above every other kid&#x2019;s father. But there was one last thing that absolutely sealed the deal my dad was a star.<br><br>Our den proved it. It was down in the basement, across from my mom&#x2019;s laundry room, and it was filled with scrapbooks and plaques and medals. Two walls were covered with framed newspaper articles. It was the headlines of those articles that told his story. I used to go downstairs into the den, pick up one of the game balls that he kept in a metal bin in the corner, and walk around and read them, feeling the laces and the leather of the football as I read. Mike Johnson Sets High School Yardage Record . . . Mike Johnson Leads Huskies over USC . . . Mike Johnson Named to All Pac Ten First Team . . . Mike Johnson Selected in Third Round.<br><br>Sometimes my dad would come in while I was staring at the walls. He&#x2019;d tell me about a touchdown run he&#x2019;d made in a rainstorm against Cal or the swing pass in the Sun Bowl that he&#x2019;d broken for sixty-five yards. When he finished with one of his stories, he&#x2019;d point to the two bare walls. Those are yours, Mick,&#x201d; he&#x2019;d say. You&#x2019;re going to fill them up with your own headlines.&#x201d;<br><br>My mom had been a top gymnast at the University of Washington the same years my dad was on the football team. She runs around Green Lake every morning, and she used to do the Seattle-to-Portland bicycle race, so she knows all about competition. But every time she heard my dad talk about me making the headlines, she&#x2019;d put her hands on my shoulders and look at me with her dark eyes. You don&#x2019;t have to fill any walls with anything,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d say. You just be you.&#x201d; Then she&#x2019;d point her finger at my dad. And you stop with all that bare walls&#x2019; stuff.&#x201d;<br><br>My dad would laugh. A little pressure is good for a boy.

The text is written in Uthmani style and has case vowelization and dotting on the letters that are audible.

This technique helps simplify the rules of recitation for the reader in order to encourage and facilitate correct Qur&#x2019;anic recitation. The text is color-coded: grey indicates when a letter is not pronounced, red indicates letters which require expanded vocalization, green indicates nasalization and blue shows the emphatic pronunciation of the letter.

Dame Agatha Christie was a woman who scrupulously kept her private life hidden from view, dodging the press, granting no interviews, and even, for a brief time, famously disappearing. But shortly after the great lady's death, the silence was broken when <em>An Autobiography</em> was finally published.</p><p>The witty, insightful, and immensely entertaining reflections of a marvelous talent, <em>An Autobiography</em> is as compulsively readable as Christie's novels. In her own inimitable style, a brilliant eccentric whose life encapsulated her times sheds light on her past, including her childhood in Victorian England, her volunteer work during World War II, and, of course, her phenomenal career. Agatha Christie's <em>An Autobiography</em> brings into sharp focus a beloved and enduring literary icon whose imagination continues to mesmerize readers to this very day.</p><p>Agatha Christie is the most widely published author of all time, outsold only by the Bible and Shakespeare. Her books have sold more than a billion copies in English and another billion in a hundred foreign languages.

"The Case for Christ" is a provocative and spellbinding read, marshaling expert testimony and persuasive evidence for the truth about history's most compelling figure.</p></p><p><i>The Case for Christ</i> records Lee Strobel's attempt to "determine if there's credible evidence that Jesus of Nazareth really is the Son of God." The book consists primarily of interviews between Strobel (a former legal editor at the <i>Chicago Tribune</i>) and biblical scholars such as Bruce Metzger. Each interview is based on a simple question, concerning historical evidence (for example, "Can the Biographies of Jesus Be Trusted?"), scientific evidence, ("Does Archaeology Confirm or Contradict Jesus' Biographies?"), and "psychiatric evidence" ("Was Jesus Crazy When He Claimed to Be the Son of God?"). Together, these interviews compose a case brief defending Jesus' divinity, and urging readers to reach a verdict of their own.A Seasoned Journalist Chases Down the Leads in the Biggest News Story in History If you were a journalist, how would you handle a news story so big it would utterly eclipse all other world events? How thorough would your investigation be? How many hard-hitting questions would you ask? How carefully would you consult with top experts to get detailed, accurate answers? Lee Strobel knows firsthand. It was as a reporter for the Chicago Tribune and an avowed atheist that he first investigated the greatest news story of all--the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Now, in The Case for Christ, he presents compelling evidence and expert testimony for the claims of Christianity. As a seasoned journalist with a Yale law background, Strobel systematically tracks down his leads and asks the blunt, tough questions readers themselves would want to ask--questions that can make or break the Christian faith. He refuses contrived, simplistic answers. Instead, he pieces together hard facts through interviews with more than a dozen of the country's top scholars. Written in the style of a blockbuster investigative report, The Case for Christ is apologetics at its most imaginative--gripping, compelling, marshaling expert testimony and incontrovertible evidence. With unerring instincts, Strobel ferrets out Historical Evidence: Do we possess reliable documents concerning the life, teachings, and resurrection of Jesus? Scientific Evidence: Is there archaeological substantiation for the historical accounts about Jesus? Did Jesus perform miracles? <p>Psychiatric Evidence: Did Jesus really claim to be God? What evidence is there that he fit God's profile? Fingerprint Evidence: What does prophecy have to say about Jesus? Other evidence: Jesus' death, the missing body, eyewitness accounts, and claims of personal encounters. The Case for Christ reads like a captivating, fast-paced novel. But it's not fiction. It's a riveting journey to the truth about the most remarkable event in history: the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. And it's a revealing, personal testimony to his power to transform people yet today--even the most cynical, hard-bitten journalist.</p></p><h2>Toradora!

These frameworks serve as a way for educators to identify struggling readers and provide the small-group instruction they need to improve their skills. But the success stories are too few in number, and most schools have too little to show for their efforts. What accounts for the difference? What are successful schools doing that sets them apart? <p> Author and education consultant Susan Hall provides answers in the form of 10 success factors for implementing MTSS. Based on her experience in schools across the United States, she explains the "whys" and "hows" of </p><p> * Grouping by skill deficit and using diagnostic assessments to get helpful data for grouping and regrouping.</p><p> * Implementing an instructional delivery model, including the "walk-to-intervention" model.</p><p> * Using intervention time wisely and being aware of what makes intervention effective.</p><p> * Providing teachers with the materials they need for effective lessons and delivering differentiated professional development for administrators, reading coaches, teachers, and instructional assistants.</p><p> * Monitoring progress regularly and conducting nonevaluative observations of intervention instruction. </p><p> Practical, comprehensive, and evidence-based, 10 Success Factors for Literacy Intervention provides the guidance educators need to move from disappointing results to solid gains in students' literacy achievement.</p><b>Dr. Susan L.

When Frank designs an antimatter motor flying bike to submit for Midville's Science Prize, his idea is stolen&#x2014;along with Klink and Klank&#x2014;by his rival, T. Edison, and Edison's sidekick, Mr. Chimp, an actual chimp who communicates through sign language. But, with a bit of ingenuity, and a little help from his Grampa Al and his friend Watson, Frank is able to thwart Edison's plans and rescue the two robots. Sciezka writes in the present tense, creating a fast-paced read, and offers plenty of science facts for children. Biggs's cartoon drawings cleverly add to the story, particularly his illustrations of Mr. Chimp's sign language, which are seamlessly interspersed as dialogue throughout the text. Although not entirely original as a character, Frank is likable and resourceful, while Edison makes for a diabolical but predictable villain. However, children will enjoy the matter-of-fact Klink, affable Klank, and droll Mr. Chimp, all of whom provide the majority of the laughs in the book and inject some novelty into an otherwise standard story.

Yet even children recognize that tearing one into small pieces is an act of inconceivable stupidity. What makes a $20 bill actually worth twenty dollars? In the third volume of his best-selling <em>Naked</em> series, Charles Wheelan uses this seemingly simple question to open the door to the surprisingly colorful world of money and banking.</p><p>The search for an answer triggers countless other questions along the way: Why does paper money (&#x201c;fiat currency&#x201d; if you want to be fancy) even exist? And why do some nations, like Zimbabwe in the 1990s, print so much of it that it becomes more valuable as toilet paper than as currency? How do central banks use the power of money creation to stop financial crises? Why does most of Europe share a common currency, and why has that arrangement caused so much trouble? And will payment apps, bitcoin, or other new technologies render all of this moot?</p><p>In <em>Naked Money</em>, Wheelan tackles all of the above and more, showing us how our banking and monetary systems should work in ideal situations and revealing the havoc and suffering caused in real situations by inflation, deflation, illiquidity, and other monetary effects. Throughout, Wheelan&#x2019;s uniquely bright-eyed, whimsical style brings levity and clarity to a subject often devoid of both. With illuminating stories from Argentina, Zimbabwe, North Korea, America, China, and elsewhere around the globe, Wheelan demystifies the curious world behind the paper in our wallets and the digits in our bank accounts.</p> 15 illustrations</p><p>Charles Wheelan is the author of the best-selling Naked Statistics and Naked Economics and is a former correspondent for The Economist.

Economic instabilities, eruptions of violence, and natural catastrophes can alter the lives and landscapes of entire communities. Our individual lives are often just as unsteady: relationships can break, plans can falter, and confidence can fail. </p> <p>Uncertainty can definitely be uncomfortable. Many of us prefer stability and a predictable future to an unknown fate. We are wired to want to control our destiny.</p> <p> The reality is that in our fast-changing, unpredictable world there are few guarantees in life. It's those who are willing to embrace uncertainty and make the risky decision to follow Jesus despite the many "unknowns" who will reap the greatest rewards. </p> <p><em>Embracing the Uncertain</em> invites readers this Lent to engage and wrestle with life&#x2019;s uncertainties, not ignore them. The first six chapters focus on six post-Transfiguration, pre-Passion stories in the Gospels. Each of these stories are signposts in the gospel narrative, pointing down at a world filled with uncertainty, but pointing us forward to a cross that can show us how to follow Jesus with courage, hope, and obedience. Includes discussion questions that can be used in small-group Bible study session or for personal growth. </p></p><p><p><strong>Magrey R. deVega</strong> is the Senior Pastor at Hyde Park United Methodist Church in Tampa, Florida.

From <i>Gidget</i>'s sweet-faced "girl next door" to the dazzling complexity of <i>Sybil</i> to the Academy Award-worthy ferocity and depth of <i>Norma Rae </i>and Mary Todd Lincoln, Field has stunned audiences time and time again with her artistic range and emotional acuity. Yet there is one character who always remained hidden: the shy and anxious little girl within.<br>With raw honesty and the fresh, pitch-perfect prose of a natural-born writer, and with all the humility and authenticity her fans have come to expect, Field brings readers behind-the-scenes for not only the highs and lows of her star-studded early career in Hollywood, but deep into the truth of her lifelong relationships--including her complicated love for her own mother. Powerful and unforgettable, <i>In Pieces</i> is an inspiring and important account of life as a woman in the second half of the twentieth century. <br></p><p>Sally Field is a two-time Academy Award and three-time Emmy Award winning actor who has portrayed dozens of iconic roles on both the large and small screens. In 2012, she was inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and in 2015 she was honored by President Obama with the National Medal of Arts. She has served on the Board of Directors of Vital Voices since 2002 and also served on the Board of The Sundance Institute from 1994 to 2010. She has three sons and five grandchildren.<i>NEW YORK TIMES </i>BESTSELLER<br><br>"A classic in the making - the kind that will land on the bestseller list...and stay on shelves for years to come."&#x2015;<b><i>Boris Kachka, New York Magazine</i></b><br><br>"Field fuels this aching, lyrical memoir with frankness about her emotional childhood, her conflicted relationship with the late Burt Reynolds, and how acting helped her interpret life in all its pain and beauty."&#x2015;<b><i>Entertainment Weekly</i></b><br><br>"A memoir <b>as soulful, wryly witty, and lyrical as it is candid and courageous</b>... Eye-opening and deeply affecting... Arresting in its dark disclosures, vitality, humour, and grace, Field's <b>deeply felt and beautifully written</b> memoir illuminates the experiences and emotions on which she draws as an exceptionally charismatic, empathic, and powerful artist."&#x2015;<b><i>Booklist</i></b><br><br> "Field holds nothing back...This powerful, timely narrative resonates with pain and triumph." <br><br>&#x2015;<b><i><i>Library Journal,</i> Best Books of 2018</i></b><br><br> "A complex <i>cri de coeur</i> [and] shockingly frank...A rarity in the world of celebrity memoirs."&#x2015;<b><i> USA Today</i></b><br><br>"Clarity and Grace Shine Through the Darkness in Sally Field's Memoir... If you come to "In Pieces," expecting to meet a plucky Sally Field desperate to be liked, you will not find her. Written by the actor over seven years, without the aid of a ghostwriter, this somber, intimate and at times wrenching self-portrait feels like an act of personal investigation - the private act of a woman, now 71, seeking to understand how she became herself, and striving to cement together the shards of her psyche that have been chipped and shattered over the course of her life..."In Pieces" serves as a kind of tribute to women - her mother in particular - and others who would guide and protect Field throughout her turbulent childhood and an adulthood fraught by personal and professional upheaval."&#x2015;<b><i>New York Times Book Review</i></b><br><br>"Award-winning actress Sally Field could have written a typically dishy Hollywood memoir. But her book, In Pieces, is an intensely personal, vulnerable accounting of her life and career. Field's meditations on memory, fear and love will leave you shattered. Her lyrical prose and sly humor will glue you back together again."&#x2015;<b><i><i>NPR, </i>Best Books of 2018</i></b><br><br>"Raw and revealing...In her book, seven years in the writing, [Field] examines the complex relationship with her "perfectly imperfect" mother, Margaret.

From his infancy, when he bewitches animals and bends them to his will (stealing a herd of Apollo&#x2019;s prize cattle in the bargain), to his adolescence and adulthood when he becomes father to the equally mischievous Pan, Hermes&#x2019;s story is wildly entertaining as he brings a little bit of chaos to everything he touches or creates. This volume is sure to be a fan favorite with its wit, charm, and storytelling.</p></p><p>George O'Connor is the author of several picture books, including the New York Times bestseller <i>Kapow!, Kersplash</i>, and <i>Sally and the Some-Thing.</i> His debut graphic novel, <i>Journey into Mohawk Country,</i> was published by First Second, as was Adam Rapp's Ball Peen Hammer, which O'Connor illustrated. His series The Olympians includes such titles as <i>Poseidon, Hera, Athena, Hades, </i>and <i>Zeus.</i>POPGr 4&#x2013;8&#x2014;Hermes, Greek god of thieves and liars (and much more), gets his due in the latest installment of the "Olympians" series. A wandering traveler, accompanied by a dog, relates tales of the roguish yet charismatic deity to entertain the watchman Argus, a giant covered in eyes. As a newborn, Hermes steals a herd of his half brother Apollo's cows, then cleverly covers his tracks. Though the impish youngster provokes his older sibling's rage, he charms his way into his father Zeus's good graces and a throne on Mount Olympus. Readers, and Argus, learn of Hermes's other talents and his offspring, including the mischievous half-goat, half-human Pan. The playful tone soon turns ominous as Hermes plays a pivotal role in the epic showdown between the Olympians and the monstrous Typhon. O'Connor retells well-known legends with panache, crafting an affectionate portrait of a complex figure and presenting the Olympians as a surprisingly tight-knit and loving family. The book ends with an appropriately witty twist that's bound to have readers seeking out more information on the tale of Argus and Io. Vibrant, energetic illustrations portray athletic gods and goddesses, grotesque beasts, and frenzied battles, veering between cartoonish humor and intense drama. As always, O'Connor's copious research is evident and his love of all things Greek is contagious.

Martin and Laura Godwin, with illustrations by Caldecott Medal winner Brian Selznick. Two paper dolls based on the characters are also included in this boxed set. THE DOLL PEOPLEAnnabelle Doll is eight years old-she has been for more than a hundred years. Not a lot has happened to her, cooped up in the dollhouse, with the same doll family, day after day, year after year . . . until one day the Funcrafts move in. THE MEANEST DOLL IN THE WORLDIn this sequel to <em>The Doll People</em>, Annabelle Doll and Tiffany Funcraft hitch a ride in Kate's backpack and find themselves in the biggest adventure of their lives: a day at school! But when an attempt to return home lands them in the wrong house, they're in far deeper trouble than they imagined. Along with a host of new doll friends, they also encounter Mean Mimi, the wickedest doll of all. THE RUNAWAY DOLLSBest friends Annabelle Doll and Tiffany Funcraft have an unexpected visitor, a new doll named Tilly May. She's arrived in a mysterious package from London, but her face looks so familiar . . . could she be Annabelle's long lost baby sister? With time running out before the package is sent back to England, Annabelle and Tiffany resort to the only course of action they can think of-running away. But how will Annabelle and Tiffany find their way back home . . . and what will happen to Tilly May?</p><p>Annabelle Doll is 8 years old--and has been for over 100 years. Nothing much has changed in the dollhouse during that time, except for the fact that 45 years ago, Annabelle's Auntie Sarah disappeared from the dollhouse without a trace. After all this time, restless Annabelle is becoming more and more curious about her aunt's fate. And when she discovers Auntie Sarah's old diary, she becomes positively driven. Her cautious family tries to discourage her, but Annabelle won't be stopped, even though she risks Permanent Doll State, in which she could turn into a regular, nonliving doll. And when the "Real Pink Plastic" Funcraft family moves in next door, the Doll family's world is turned upside down--in more ways than one! <p> Fans of <i>The Borrowers</i> and <i>Stuart Little</i> will love this exciting story of adventure and mystery. The relationship between the two doll families, one antique, one modern, is hilariously, wonderfully drawn. The Funcrafts are reckless and raucous, with fearlessness born of their unbreakable plastic parts. The Doll family is reserved and somewhat prim, even though they occasionally break into '60s tunes like "Respect" in their sing-alongs. Annabelle is a heroine with integrity and gumption. Ann Martin (The Babysitters Club series) and Laura Godwin create a witty, intriguing tale, illustrated with humor and a clever eye for detail by Brian Selznick.

They&#x2019;re really not too much to ask.</p><p>The first is to attend the winter formal dressed like Marie Antoinette. I want a wig so elaborate it could cage a bird and a dress so wide I&#x2019;ll only be able to enter the dance through a set of double doors. But I&#x2019;ll hold my skirts high as I arrive to reveal a pair of platform combat boots, so everyone can see that, underneath the frills, I&#x2019;m punk-rock tough.</p><p>The second is for my parents to approve of my boyfriend. They hate him. They hate his bleached hair with its constant dark roots, and they hate his arms, which are tattooed with sleeves of spiderwebs and stars. They say his eyebrows condescend, that his smile is more of a smirk. And they&#x2019;re sick of hearing his music blasting from my bedroom, and they&#x2019;re tired of fighting about my curfew whenever I watch his band play in clubs.</p><p>And my third wish?</p><p>To never ever ever see the Bell twins ever again. Ever.</p><p>But I&#x2019;d much rather discuss my boyfriend. I realize it&#x2019;s not cool to desire parental approval, but honestly, my life would be so much easier if they accepted that Max is <i>the one.</i> It&#x2019;d mean the end of embarrassing restrictions, the end of every-hour-on-thehour phone-call check-ins on dates, and&#x2014;best of all&#x2014;the end of Sunday brunch.</p><p>The end of mornings like this.</p><p>&#x201c;Another waffle, Max?&#x201d;</p><p>My father, Nathan, pushes the golden stack across our antique farmhouse table and toward my boyfriend. This is not a real question. It&#x2019;s a command, so that my parents can continue their interrogation before we leave. Our reward for dealing with brunch? A more relaxed Sunday-afternoon date with fewer check-ins.</p><p>Max takes two and helps himself to the homemade raspberry-peach syrup. &#x201c;Thanks, sir. Incredible, as always.&#x201d; He pours the syrup carefully, a drop in each square. Despite appearances, Max is careful by nature. This is why he never drinks or smokes pot on Saturday nights. He doesn&#x2019;t want to come to brunch looking hungover, which is, of course, what my parents are watching for. Evidence of debauchery.</p><p>&#x201c;Thank Andy.&#x201d; Nathan jerks his head toward my other dad, who runs a pie bakery out of our home. &#x201c;He made them.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Delicious. Thank you, sir.&#x201d; Max never misses a beat. &#x201c;Lola, did you get enough?&#x201d;</p><p>I stretch, and the seven inches of Bakelite bracelets on my right arm knock against each other. &#x201c;Yeah, like, twenty minutes ago. Come on,&#x201d; I turn and plead to Andy, the candidate most likely to let us leave early. &#x201c;Can&#x2019;t we go now?&#x201d;</p><p>He bats his eyes innocently. &#x201c;More orange juice? Frittata?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No.&#x201d; I fight to keep from slumping. Slumping is unattractive.</p><p>Nathan stabs another waffle. &#x201c;So. Max. How goes the world of meter reading?&#x201d;</p><p>When Max isn&#x2019;t being an indie punk garage-rock god, he works for the City of San Francisco. It irks Nathan that Max has no interest in college. But what my dad doesn&#x2019;t grasp is that Max is actually brilliant. He reads complicated philosophy books written by people with names I can&#x2019;t pronounce and watches tons of angry political documentaries. I certainly wouldn&#x2019;t debate him.</p><p>Max smiles politely, and his dark eyebrows raise a titch. &#x201c;The same as last week.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And the band?&#x201d; Andy asks. &#x201c;Wasn&#x2019;t some record executive supposed to come on Friday?&#x201d;</p><p>My boyfriend frowns. The guy from the label never showed. Max updates Andy about Amphetamine&#x2019;s forthcoming album instead, while Nathan and I exchange scowls. No doubt my father is disappointed that, once again, he hasn&#x2019;t found anything to incriminate Max. Apart from the age thing, of course.</p><p>Which is the real reason my parents hate my boyfriend.</p><p>They hate that I&#x2019;m seventeen, and Max is twenty-two.</p><p>But I&#x2019;m a firm believer in age-doesn&#x2019;t-matter. Besides, it&#x2019;s only five years, way less than the difference between my parents. Though it&#x2019;s no use pointing this out, or the fact that my boyfriend is the same age Nathan was when my parents started dating. This only gets them worked up. &#x201c;<i>I</i> may have been his age, but Andy was thirty,&#x201d; Nathan always says. &#x201c;Not a teenager. And we&#x2019;d both had several boyfriends before, plenty of life experience. You can&#x2019;t jump into these things.You have to be careful.&#x201d;</p><p>But they don&#x2019;t remember what it&#x2019;s like to be young and in love. Of course I can jump into these things. When it&#x2019;s someone like Max, I&#x2019;d be stupid not to. My best friend thinks it&#x2019;s hilarious that my parents are so strict. After all, shouldn&#x2019;t a couple of gay men sympathize with the temptation offered by a sexy, slightly dangerous boyfriend?</p><p>This is so far from the truth it&#x2019;s painful.</p><p>It doesn&#x2019;t matter that I&#x2019;m a perfect daughter. I don&#x2019;t drink or do drugs, and I&#x2019;ve never smoked a cigarette. I haven&#x2019;t crashed their car&#x2014;I can&#x2019;t even drive, so they&#x2019;re not paying high insurance rates&#x2014;and I have a decent job. I make good grades. Well, apart from biology, but I refused to dissect that fetal pig on principle. And I only have one hole per ear and no ink. Yet. I&#x2019;m not even embarrassed to hug my parents in public.</p><p>Except when Nathan wears a sweatband when he goes running. Because really.</p><p>I clear my dishes from the table, hoping to speed things along. Today Max is taking me to one of my favorite places, the Japanese Tea Garden, and then he&#x2019;s driving me to work for my evening shift. And hopefully, in between stops, we&#x2019;ll spend some quality time together in his &#x2019;64 Chevy Impala.</p><p>I lean against the kitchen countertop, dreaming of Max&#x2019;s car.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m just shocked she&#x2019;s not wearing her kimono,&#x201d; Nathan says.</p><p>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; I hate it when I space out and realize people have been talking about me.</p><p>&#x201c;Chinese pajamas to the Japanese Tea Garden,&#x201d; he continues, gesturing at my red silk bottoms. &#x201c;What <i>will</i> people think?&#x201d;</p><p>I don&#x2019;t believe in fashion. I believe in costume. Life is too short to be the same person every day. I roll my eyes to show Max that I realize my parents are acting lame.</p><p>&#x201c;Our little drag queen,&#x201d; Andy says.</p><p>&#x201c;Because that&#x2019;s a new one.&#x201d; I snatch his plate and dump the brunch remains into Betsy&#x2019;s bowl. Her eyes bug, and she inhales the waffle scraps in one big doggie bite.</p><p>Betsy&#x2019;s full name is Heavens to Betsy, and we rescued her from animal control several years ago. She&#x2019;s a mutt, built like a golden retriever but black in color. I wanted a black dog, because Andy once clipped a magazine article&#x2014;he&#x2019;s <i>always</i> clipping articles, usually about teens dying from overdoses or contracting syphilis or getting pregnant and dropping out of school&#x2014;about how black dogs are always the last to be adopted at shelters and, therefore, more likely to be put down. Which is totally Dog Racism, if you ask me. Betsy is all heart.</p><p>&#x201c;Lola.&#x201d; Andy is wearing his serious face. &#x201c;I wasn&#x2019;t finished.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So get a new plate.&#x201d;</p><p><i>&#x201c;Lola,&#x201d;</i> Nathan says, and I give Andy a clean plate. I&#x2019;m afraid they&#x2019;re about to turn this into A Thing in front of Max, when they notice Betsy begging for more waffles.</p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; I tell her.</p><p>&#x201c;Have you walked her today?&#x201d; Nathan asks me.</p><p>&#x201c;No, Andy did.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Before I started cooking,&#x201d; Andy says. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s ready for another.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you take her for a walk while we finish up with Max?&#x201d; Nathan asks. Another command, not a question.</p><p>I glance at Max, and he closes his eyes like he can&#x2019;t believe they&#x2019;re pulling this trick again. &#x201c;But, Dad&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No buts. You wanted the dog, you walk her.&#x201d;</p><p>This is one of Nathan&#x2019;s most annoying catchphrases. Heavens to Betsy was supposed to be mine, but she had the nerve to fall in love with Nathan instead, which irritates Andy and me to no end. We&#x2019;re the ones who feed and walk her. I reach for the biodegradable baggies and her leash&#x2014;the one I&#x2019;ve embroidered with hearts and Russian nesting dolls&#x2014;and she&#x2019;s already going berserk. &#x201c;Yeah, yeah. Come on.&#x201d;</p><p>I shoot Max another apologetic look, and then Betsy and I are out the door.</p><p>There are twenty-one stairs from our porch to the sidewalk. Anywhere you go in San Francisco, you have to deal with steps and hills. It&#x2019;s unusually warm outside, so along with my pajama bottoms and Bakelite bangles, I&#x2019;m wearing a tank top. I&#x2019;ve also got on my giant white Jackie O sunglasses, a long brunette wig with emerald tips, and black ballet slippers. <i>Real</i> ballet slippers, not the flats that only look like ballet slippers.</p><p>My New Year&#x2019;s resolution was to never again wear the same outfit twice.</p><p>The sunshine feels good on my shoulders. It doesn&#x2019;t matter that it&#x2019;s August; because of the bay, the temperature doesn&#x2019;t change much throughout the year. It&#x2019;s always cool. Today I&#x2019;m grateful for the peculiar weather, because it means I won&#x2019;t have to bring a sweater on my date.</p><p>Betsy pees on the teeny rectangle of grass in front of the lavender Victorian next door&#x2014;she always pees here, which I totally approve of&#x2014;and we move on. Despite my annoying parents, I&#x2019;m happy. I have a romantic date with my boyfriend, a great schedule with my favorite coworkers, and one more week of summer vacation.</p><p>We hike up and down the massive hill that separates my street from the park. When we arrive, a Korean gentleman in a velveteen tracksuit greets us. He&#x2019;s doing tai chi between the palm trees. &#x201c;Hello, Dolores! How was your birthday?&#x201d; Mr. Lim is the only person apart from my parents (when they&#x2019;re mad) who calls me by my real name. His daughter Lindsey is my best friend; they live a few streets over.</p><p>&#x201c;Hi, Mr. Lim. It was divine!&#x201d; My birthday was last week. Mine is the earliest of anyone in my grade, which I love. It gives me an additional air of maturity. &#x201c;How&#x2019;s the restaurant?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Very good, thank you. Everyone asking for beef galbi this week. Goodbye, Dolores! Hello to your parents.&#x201d;</p><p>The old lady name is because I was named after one. My great-grandma Dolores Deeks died a few years before I was born. She was Andy&#x2019;s grandmother, and she was fabulous. The kind of woman who wore feathered hats and marched in civil rights protests. Dolores was the first person Andy came out to. He was thirteen. They were really close, and when she die...</p></p><h2>Outlander&#39;s Scotland</h2><p>"Billow and breeze, islands and seas, Mountains of rain and sun........."

A native of Manitoba, Canada, Fred has worn many hats from folk-rock singer, television host and home video star to children&#39;s book author, UNICEF Canada spokesman, husband and father of four!PreSchool-Grade 1. This book begins "Walking through the jungle,/Walking through the jungle,/What do you see?/What do you see?/I think I see a lion,/Chasing after me,/Chasing after me" and continues in this vein as a girl meets five more animals. The text is extremely similar in concept and rhythm to Bill Martin's Brown Bear, Brown Bear... (1983) and Polar Bear, Polar Bear... (1991, both Holt). The bold double-page artwork will draw readers instantly, and they'll find themselves poring over the brightly colored, stunning, acrylic illustrations. Varying facial expressions cleverly convey happiness or fear on the faces of the main character and animals as they encounter one fierce creature after another. While children will enjoy this book, it's unfortunate that it's so close in concept and cadence to Martin's books.?Barbara McGinn, Oak Hill Elementary School, Severna Park, MD<br>Copyright 1997 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Practice You: A Journal</h2><p><p>When the way forward seems uncertain, where can we turn for guidance we can trust?

She lives Benicia, California.The furnishings are few in this chilly Eskimo dwelling, but when Michael jumps in Mother's lap, the love between them warms the room, as "back and forth, back and forth, they rock." Michael runs to get Dolly, then his carved boat, a reindeer blanket and even his puppy: the small rocking chair is full. When Baby cries, Mother insists there's room for her too, but Michael pouts and hides. All of them end up back in the chair, crowded but cozy; Michael admits, "It feels good." Pastels in earth tones and turquoise create a luminous setting with the captivating faces of the serene mother and her two small children. Though the story is very slight, it makes a reassuring point for little ones, who need to know that a mother's love is an expandable quantity.

But this leads to an inescapable question: why should we trust the Bible? Written to help non-Christians, longtime Christians, and everyone in between better understand why God&#x2019;s Word is reliable, this short book explores the historical and theological arguments that have helped lead millions of believers through the centuries to trust the Bible, from Genesis to Revelation. Written by pastor Greg Gilbert, author of the popular books&nbsp;<em>What Is the Gospel?</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Who Is Jesus?</em>, this volume will help Christians articulate why they trust the Bible when it comes to who God is, who we are, and how we&#x2019;re supposed to live.</p></p><p><p><strong>Greg Gilbert</strong> (MDiv, The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary) is senior pastor at Third Avenue Baptist Church in Louisville, Kentucky. He is the author of <em>What Is the Gospel?</em>, <em>James: A 12-Week Study</em>, and <em>Who Is Jesus?</em>, and is the co-author (with Kevin DeYoung) of <em>What Is the Mission of the Church?</em></p><p>Senior Pastor, Third Avenue Baptist Church, Louisville, Kentucky; author, <em>What Is the Gospel?</em></p><p>&#x201c;Now more than ever, Christians need to know how to defend the truth of God&#x2019;s Word in the midst of an increasingly hostile world. In this book for Christians and non-Christians alike, Gilbert sets forth compelling arguments in support of the trustworthiness of the Bible&#x2015;equipping believers with an important tool for engaging a skeptical world.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Josh McDowell</strong>, author and speaker</p><p>&#x201c;This book fills a great need in a day when people raise all kinds of legitimate questions about the Bible and its trustworthiness before they&#x2019;ll even open it to take a look. Greg Gilbert&#x2019;s <em>Why Trust the Bible?</em> answers that question by examining a series of issues people often raise in order to not take a look at this greatest of books. In everyday language, he shows why we can trust Scripture and pay attention to what it says about life.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Darrell L. Bock,</strong> Executive Director of Cultural Engagement, The Hendricks Center, Dallas Theological Seminary</p><p>&#x201c;&#x2018;Can we really trust the Bible?&#x2019; It&#x2019;s an important question to consider, especially in the face of our culture&#x2019;s skepticism. Greg Gilbert takes on this question directly, providing clear and convincing answers that will help the reader fully trust the Scriptures. Why Trust the Bible? is a great resource for equipping Christians to passionately defend the Bible, and it also challenges skeptics to rethink their position. I benefitted greatly from reading this book.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Christian Wegert,</strong> Senior Pastor, Arche Gemeinde, Hamburg, Germany</p><p>&#x201c;This outstanding book provides a magnificent summary of the evidence in support of the Bible&#x2019;s historicity. It is well argued, brief, thorough, highly readable, and compelling. I not only recommend it but will also seek to give it to many friends&#x2015;both believers and skeptics.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>William Taylor,&nbsp;</strong>Rector, St. Helen's Bishopsgate, London; author,&nbsp;<em>Understanding the Times</em> and <em>Partnership</em></p><p>&#x201c;Many students I meet know that they should trust the Bible, but they don&#x2019;t know why&#x2015;and so they often don&#x2019;t. This book tackles that question with clarity and ease. Well researched and accessibly written, this will be one of my new go-to resources for earnest seekers and new believers.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>J. D. Greear,</strong> President, Southern Baptist Convention; author, <em>Not God Enough</em>; Pastor, The Summit Church, Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina</p><p>&#x201c;Greg Gilbert makes for a friendly, convincing guide along one important pathway to trusting the Bible. He lays out an amazingly simple strand of good sense that weaves its way right through the many complex arguments for Scripture&#x2019;s reliability as a historical document. For those investigating the Bible&#x2015;and for those who love to share it&#x2015;this book lights the way, not only to clear thinking about Scripture but also to meeting the risen Christ.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Kathleen Nielson,</strong>&nbsp;author; speaker; Senior Adviser, The Gospel Coalition&nbsp;</p></p><h2>Carson Dellosa | Science Interactive Notebook | 4th Grade, 96pgs (Interactive Notebooks)</h2><p>Interactive Notebooks: Science for grade 4 is a fun way to teach and reinforce effective note taking for students.

A side door bursts open.<br><br>Soldiers pour into the room. They're shouting and waving rifles.<br><br>I shield my head with my arms. It was a lie! I think, my mind racing.<br><br>Girls and boys alike are screaming. The soldiers prod and herd some of us together and push the rest apart as if we're cows or goats.<br><br>Their leader, though, is a middle-aged man. He's moving slowly, intently, not dashing around like the others. "Take the boys only, Win Min," I overhear him telling a tall, gangly soldier. "Make them obey."</i><br><br>Chiko isn't a fighter by nature. He's a book-loving Burmese boy whose father, a doctor, is in prison for resisting the government. Tu Reh, on the other hand, wants to fight for freedom after watching Burmese soldiers destroy his Karenni family's home and bamboo fields. Timidity becomes courage and anger becomes compassion as each boy is changed by unlikely friendships formed under extreme circumstances.</p><p>For three years my husband, children, and I lived in Chiang Mai, Thailand. While we were there we visited the Karenni refugee camps along the Thai-Burma border. I was astounded at how the Karenni kept their hopes up despite incredible loss, still dreaming and talking of the day when they would once again become a free people. I was impressed, too, by how creatively they used bamboo. Homes, bridges, transportation, weapons, food, storage, irrigation--all these and more depended on the resilient, lavish, and ecologically efficient bamboo plant. I began to think about that plant as an excellent symbol for the peoples of that region.<br><br>During that time I also began to understand how tough life is for Burmese teenagers. Only about a third are enrolled in school, and most can't find jobs. According to international human rights organizations, Burma has the largest number of child soldiers in the world, and that number is growing. These young soldiers are taught that the Karenni and other ethnic groups are the cause of the problems in their country and are rewarded with money and food if they burn, destroy, torture, and kill ethnic minorities.<br><br>What would you do if your mother was hungry and your only option to feed her was to fight in the army? What about if you saw soldiers burning your home and farm while you ran for your life? Wouldn't you be terrified, like Chiko? Wouldn't you be angry, like Tu Reh?<br><br>In my travels far and wide, I've learned two things: all people feel powerful negative emotions, but we all face choices when it comes to acting on them.<br><br>I hope you connect with Tu Reh and Chiko as you read&nbsp;<i>Bamboo People</i>. If you want to promote peace and democracy in Burma or help refugees fleeing from that country, please browse bamboopeople.org where I provide resources, an educator's guide, and suggestions for involvement.Chiko isn't a fighter by nature. He's a book-smart Burmese boy whose father, a doctor, is in prison for resisting the government. When Chiko is forced into the army by trickery, he must find the courage to survive the mental and physical punishment meted out by the training facility's menacing captain.<br><br>Tu Reh can't forget the image of the Burmese soldiers burning his home and the bamboo fields of his oppressed Karenni people, one of the many ethnic minorities in Burma. Now living in a Karenni refugee camp on the Thai border, Tu Reh is consumed with anger and the need for revenge. He can't wait to join his father and the other resistance fighters in their efforts to protect the Karenni people.<br><br>Chiko and Tu Reh's stories come to a violent intersection as each boy is sent on his first mission into the jungle. Extreme circumstances and unlikely friendships force each boy to confront what it means to be a man of his people.<br><br>Set against the political and military backdrop of modern-day Burma, Bamboo People explores the nature of violence, power, and prejudice as well as the healing power of tolerance.</p><h2>US Open: 50 Years of Championship Tennis</h2><p>Timed to coincide with the US Open&#x2019;s 50th anniversary, this exquisitely produced book celebrates the most electrifying event in tennis.

She has come up with activities, like a Lily Pad Dance, she&#x2019;s thought of games to play, and she&#x2019;s created all sorts of fun hats, masks, and other costumes for her friends to wear. But the day of the Spring Fling is approaching, and Sophie&#x2019;s twitching whiskers are telling her that the rain is too! Sure enough, it rains and it pours. Will Sophie figure out a way to save the day or will all her hard work go to down the drain?<br> <br>With easy-to-read language and illustrations on almost every page, the Adventures of Sophie Mouse chapter books are perfect for beginning readers.</p><p>Poppy Green can talk to animals! Unfortunately, they never talk back to her. So she started writing in order to imagine what they might say and do when humans aren&#x2019;t watching. Poppy lives on the edge of the woods in Connecticut, where her backyard is often a playground for all kinds of wildlife: birds, rabbits, squirrels, voles, skunks, deer, and the occasional wild turkey.<br><br>Jennifer A.

She lives with her husband, son, and cranky cat in Minneapolis, Minnesota.It&#x2019;s Raining, It&#x2019;s Pouring <br><br> Rain, Rain, Go Away<p></p> <br>Sophie Mouse ran to the window. She glanced up at the sky. The clouds looked darker than the last time she&#x2019;d checked. Sophie stretched her hand outside. No raindrops.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not raining yet!&#x201d; Sophie cried, running back into the kitchen. Her whiskers were tingling. She could tell the rain was coming. But maybe there was just enough time for their picnic.<br> <br><br> <br>It was Sunday morning. In the Mouse family&#x2019;s house at the base of the oak tree, Mrs. Mouse had made her famous vanilla-bean scones. As they cooled, the sweet scent of the vanilla filled the kitchen.<br> <br>Mr. Mouse flipped huckleberry pancakes on the griddle. Sizzle!<br> <br>Sophie and her little brother, Winston, peeked into the oven. They had worked together to make a banana-dandelion bread. It was rising! Soon it would be done!<br> <br><br> <br>Sophie got the picnic basket ready. Then she ran upstairs to the linen closet to get the picnic blanket. She had the perfect spot in mind: on the bank of the stream near the playground. Afterward, she could scurry over to Hattie&#x2019;s house to say hello!<br> <br><br> <br>Lily Mouse tucked the scones into the basket. George Mouse added the pancakes.<br> <br><br> <br>Soon the banana-dandelion bread was done and packed, along with jams and jars of mint tea.<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay! Let&#x2019;s go!&#x201d; Sophie exclaimed.<br> <br>She picked up the basket. Winston grabbed the blanket. And the Mouse family stepped outside.<br> <br><br> <br>Plip! Plop! Plip!<br> <br>Sophie felt three big raindrops&#x2014;one on her ear, one on her shoulder, and one on the tip of her nose.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh no!&#x201d; Winston moaned.<br> <br>The four mice gazed upward, holding their palms out.<br> <br><br> <br>Plip! Plop! Plip! Plippity-plippity, plop-plop-plop . . .<br> <br><br> <br>The rain was picking up. Winston threw the blanket over the basket to protect it.<br> <br>&#x201c;I hate to say it,&#x201d; said Mr. Mouse, &#x201c;but I think we&#x2019;d better make it an indoor picnic.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Or,&#x201d; Sophie said, &#x201c;it could be fun to have a picnic in the rain. . . .&#x201d;<br> <br><br> <br>She smiled hopefully. But no one else seemed excited about the idea.<br> <br>So back inside they went. In the living room, they pushed back the furniture and spread the blanket on the floor.<br> <br>The yummy food cheered Sophie up. But now and then, she gazed out the window at the gray mist.<br> <br>Mr. Mouse patted her on the back. &#x201c;I know it&#x2019;s disappointing, Sophie,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;But we could really use the rain. We could use a lot more rain. It&#x2019;s been very dry this season.&#x201d;<br> <br><br> <br>Sophie&#x2019;s shoulders drooped. She took another bite of scone. She knew her dad was right, but she still couldn&#x2019;t help wishing the rain away.</p><h2>YOU WILL BE MY FRIEND!

Then I printed out all the pages and put them up on my wall, so I could see how they worked together as a group. I marked up the printouts with all kinds of notes to myself, and would later go back to my computer to make those changes. </td> <td> <br> After developing the story and pictures, I eventually settled on final sketches and words for every page. Using a light box, I traced the final sketches onto paper with a mechanical pencil. </td> <td> <br> I used a standard paper towel as a chamois, and rubbed the graphite to get texture and various shades of gray. </td> <td> <br> Using that paper towel chamois, mechanical pencils and erasers, I eventually ended up with final drawings. </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <br> In many cases, I would draw the different elements of an illustration separately, and combine them later with my computer. Here are a few drawings that ended up on the book cover, along with additional drawings not seen in this photo. </td> <td> <br> I also used mechanical pencils and erasers to do the hand-lettering for all of the dialogue in the story. </td> <td> <br> I cut construction paper to create word balloons, boxes for the narration text, and the background papers that would eventually be placed behind the drawings in the final illustrations. </td> <td> <br> I scanned all of the drawings, cut paper, hand lettering, and photos of wood grains into my computer. Then I adjusted the positions of the various elements of the illustrations, tinted the drawings to a sepia tone, and added transparent color to create the final art. Here you can see what the drawing looked like before and after I added the color. </td> </tr> </tbody></table><br><br> Photo credit: Gwen Schroeder <br>Peter Brown is the author and illustrator of many bestselling children's books, including <i>Children Make Terrible Pets</i> and <i>The Curious Garden</i>.

They were beyond the control of the entire community, even if they were banded together. And Morgan would not be able to simply ignore them either.

The new Netflix series updates the '80s swordtech cartoon into a heroically right-now parable about empowered women teamworking against terror.

They are, truly, perfect crimes. In fact, there&#x2019;s only one thing that links the victims. Each one of the women knew Jack Reacher&#x2014;and it&#x2019;s got him running blind.</p><p>Jack Reacher is back, dragged into what looks like a series of grisly serial murders by a team of FBI profilers who aren't totally sure he's not the killer they're looking for, but believe that even if he isn't, he's smart enough to help them find the real killer. And what they've got on the ex-MP, who's starred in three previous Lee Child thrillers (<i>Tripwire</i>, <i>Die Trying</i>, <i>Killing Floor</i>), is enough to ensure his grudging cooperation: phony charges stemming from Reacher's inadvertent involvement in a protection shakedown and the threat of harm to the woman he loves. <p> The killer's victims have only one thing in common--all of them brought sexual harassment charges against their military superiors and all resigned from the army after winning their cases. The manner, if not the cause, of their deaths is gruesomely the same: they died in their own bathtubs, covered in gallons of camouflage paint, but they didn't drown and they weren't shot, strangled, poisoned, or attacked. Even the FBI forensic specialists can't figure out why they seem to have gone willingly to their mysterious deaths. Reacher isn't sure whether the killings are an elaborate cover-up for corruption involving stolen military hardware or the work of a maniac who's smart enough to leave absolutely no clues behind. This compelling, iconic antihero dead-ends in a lot of alleys before he finally figures it out, but every one is worth exploring and the suspense doesn't let up for a second. The ending will come as a complete surprise to even the most careful reader, and as Reacher strides off into the sunset, you'll wonder what's in store for him in his next adventure. <i>--Jane Adams</i></p><b>Lee Child</b>&nbsp;is #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestsellling author of the&nbsp;Jack Reacher thrillers and the complete Jack Reacher story collection,&nbsp;<i>No Middle Name</i>.

The large, immediate illustrations and bold text will attract young audiences to this printed version of a popular song. However, while the bears resemble stuffed toys, they are life-size and lifeless. The illustrations are flat and two dimensional. Their static nature diminishes the charm of the song and is at odds with the magical premise of the tale. The attached cassette is good reason to buy this package. Its jaunty folk rhythms and banjo picking are easy to listen to over and over again. Playing the tape while looking at the book helps liven up the reading experience. The bears do fun things on this picnic, but they don't appear to be having a good time.?Martha Topol, Traverse Area District Library, Traverse City, MI<br>Copyright 1997 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Mark: A 12-Week Study (Knowing the Bible)</h2><p><p>"A tremendous resource for those wanting to study and teach the Bible with an understanding of how the gospel is woven throughout Scripture." &#x2015;Bryan Chapell, Pastor, Grace Presbyterian Church</p><p>The Knowing the Bible series is a resource designed to help Bible readers better understand and apply God&#x2019;s Word.</p><p>These 12-week studies lead participants through books of the Bible and are made up of four basic components: (1) reflection questions help readers engage the text at a deeper level; (2) &#x201c;Gospel Glimpses&#x201d; highlight the gospel of grace throughout the book; (3) &#x201c;Whole-Bible Connections&#x201d; show how any given passage connects to the Bible&#x2019;s overarching story of redemption, culminating in Christ; and (4) &#x201c;Theological Soundings&#x201d; identify how historic orthodox doctrines are taught or reinforced throughout Scripture.</p><p>With contributions from an array of influential pastors and church leaders, these gospel-centered studies will help Christians see and cherish the message of God&#x2019;s grace on every page of the Bible.</p><p>The Gospel of Mark paints an important portrait of Jesus as Israel&#x2019;s promised Messiah.

Such series often provide questions with little guidance, leaving students to their own devices. They thus tend to overlook the role of teaching in the church. By contrast, Knowing the Bible avoids the problem by providing substantial instruction with the questions. Knowing the Bible then goes even further by showing how any given passage connects with the gospel, the whole Bible, and Christian theology. I heartily endorse this orientation of individual books to the whole Bible and the gospel, and I applaud the demonstration that sound theology was not something invented later by Christians, but is right there in the pages of Scripture.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Graeme Goldsworthy,</strong>&nbsp;Former Lecturer in Old Testament, Biblical Theology, and Hermeneutics, Moore Theological College</p><p>&#x201c;What a gift to earnest, Bible-loving, Bible-searching believers!

Students of the Word are led to understand the content of passages through perceptive, guided questions, and they are given rich insights and application all along the way in the brief but illuminating sections that conclude each study.

One can only pray that vast numbers of believers will discover more of God and the beauty of his Word through these rich studies.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Bruce A. Ware,</strong>&nbsp;T.

Full facsimile of the original edition, not reproduced with Optical Recognition Software. &#34;The Conscience of a Conservative&#34; was published by Goldwater when he was an Arizona Senator and a potential 1964 Republican presidential candidate. The book reignited the American conservative movement and made Barry Goldwater a political star. The book has influenced countless conservatives in the United States, helping to lay the foundation for the Reagan Revolution in 1980. The book is considered to be a significant statement of politically and economically American conservative ideas which were to gain influence during the following decades. The book continues to inspire contemporary political commentary.</p><p>Barry Goldwater (1909&#x2013;1998) was a five-term United States Senator from Arizona and the Republican Party's nominee for President in the 1964 election. An articulate and charismatic figure during the first half of the 1960s, he was known as "Mr. Conservative". Goldwater is the politician most often credited for sparking the resurgence of the American conservative political movement in the 1960s. He also had a substantial impact on the libertarian movement. Goldwater rejected the legacy of the New Deal and fought through the conservative coalition to defeat the New Deal coalition. He mobilized a large conservative constituency to win the hard-fought Republican primaries. Goldwater's right-wing campaign platform ultimately failed to gain the support of the electorate and he lost the 1964 presidential election to incumbent Democrat Lyndon B. Johnson by one of the largest landslides in history, bringing down many Republican candidates as well. The Johnson campaign and other critics painted him as a reactionary, while supporters praised his crusades against the Soviet Union, labor unions, and the welfare state. His defeat allowed Johnson and the Democrats in Congress to pass the Great Society programs, but the defeat of so many older Republicans in 1964 also cleared the way for a younger generation of American conservatives to mobilize. Goldwater was much less active as a national leader of conservatives after 1964; his supporters mostly rallied behind Ronald Reagan, who became governor of California in 1967 and the 40th President of the United States in 1981. Goldwater returned to the Senate in 1969, and specialized in defense policy, bringing to the table his experience as a senior officer in the Air Force Reserve. His greatest accomplishment was arguably the passage of the Goldwater-Nichols Act of 1986, which restructured the higher levels of the Pentagon by increasing the power of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to direct military action. In 1974, as an elder statesman of the party, Goldwater successfully urged President Richard Nixon to resign when evidence of a cover-up in the Watergate scandal became overwhelming and impeachment was imminent. By the 1980s, the increasing influence of the Christian right on the Republican Party so conflicted with Goldwater's libertarian views that he became a vocal opponent of the religious right on issues such as abortion, gay rights and the role of religion in public life.</p><h2>Sasquatch and the Muckleshoot (The Unicorn Rescue Society)</h2><p><b>Among the towering fir trees of the Pacific Northwest, a famously elusive creature is in serious trouble.</b><br> &nbsp;<br> All Elliot wants is a nice, normal day at school.

Also Sasquatch. And mermaids&#x2014;though they are <i>not </i>what you think.</p><p>But back to unicorns. When I, Professor Mito Fauna, was a young man, I lived in the foothills of Peru. One day, there were rumors in my town of a unicorn in danger, far up in the mountains. At that instant I founded the Unicorn Rescue Society&#x2014;I was the only member&#x2014;and set off to save the unicorn. When I finally located it, though, I saw that it was <i>not </i>a unicorn, but rather a qarqacha, the legendary two-headed llama of the Andes. I was very slightly disappointed. I rescued it anyway. Of course.</p><p>Now, many years later, there are members of the Unicorn Rescue Society all around the world. We are sworn to protect all the creatures of myth and legend. Including unicorns! If we ever find them! Which I&#x2019;m sure we will!</p><p>But our enemies are powerful and ruthless, and we are in desperate need of help. Help from someone brave and kind and curious, and brave. (Yes, I said &#x201c;brave&#x201d; twice. It&#x2019;s important.)</p><p>Will you help us? Will you risk your very <i>life </i>to protect the world&#x2019;s mythical creatures?</p><p>Will you join the Unicorn Rescue Society?</p><p>I hope so. The creatures need you.</p><p><i>Defende Fabulosa! Protege Mythica! </i></p><p>Mito Fauna, DVM, PhD, EdD, etc.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>CHAPTER ONE</b></p><p>Uchenna Devereaux looked around the class�room.</p><p>Something was wrong.</p><p>All the usual kids were there. Jimmy, the big boy with the crew cut, had learned to fart to the tune of &#x201c;Happy Birthday&#x201d; over the weekend, and was showing his new skill to his pals Jasper and Johnna. They were singing along. Janey was star�ing out the window, digging into her nose with a finger&#x2014;no, now two fingers. Pai Lu was wearing black eyeshadow, black nail polish, and black lip�stick, and she sighed heavily as she read from a book of poetry by Algernon Swinburne called <i>A Ballad of Death</i>.</p><p>All of this was normal.</p><p>And yet, there was definitely something wrong. . . .</p><p>Their teacher, Miss Vole, was trying to teach them about trees. &#x201c;Do you children know what an oak tree is?&#x201d;</p><p>Uchenna sighed. Miss Vole always treated them like they were in kindergarten.</p><p>&#x201c;An oak tree is one of the tallest trees here in New Jersey. But on the West Coast, in states like California, Oregon, and Washington&#x2014;&#x201d; She paused. &#x201c;Have you heard of the West Coast, children?&#x201d;</p><p>The lesson made Uchenna want to stick a pencil through her ear canal and into her brain. Which meant Elliot, her best friend and an expert on pretty much everything, was probably ready to throw himself through one of the hermetically sealed classroom windows. Uchenna glanced at him. . . .</p><p>Elliot! That&#x2019;s what was wrong. Where was Elliot?</p><p>Uchenna swiveled around in her chair, look�ing for Elliot Eisner, the only other kid in the school who was a member of the incredibly secret Unicorn Rescue Society. What happened to him? Why wasn&#x2019;t he in school? Was he sick? Had there been an accident? Maybe one of their enemies had captured him! Or was it&#x2014;</p><p><i>BAM! </i></p><p>The door flew open, knocking three framed pictures off the wall.</p><p>Standing in the doorway was a tall man with a black-and-white beard, crazy hair, a threadbare tweed suit, and eyebrows that looked like some�thing out of a science experiment.</p><p>&#x201c;<i>Buenos d�as</i>, Miss Vole!&#x201d; Professor Fauna ex�claimed. Professor Fauna was the school social studies teacher. Everyone thought that he was a weirdo, and that he believed in unicorns, and that his office was a torture chamber under the school. Only Uchenna and Elliot knew the truth: that he was definitely a weirdo, that he did be�lieve in unicorns, and that his office under the school was not a torture chamber, but rather the headquarters of the Unicorn Rescue Society. &#x201c;I am so sorry to interrupt you,&#x201d; Professor Fauna continued. &#x201c;But I need to, ahem, borrow Elliot and Uchenna for a moment.&#x201d; His eyes landed on Uchenna, and his face lit up. He whispered to her, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s about Bigfoot!&#x201d; But because she was halfway across the room, his whisper was loud enough for everyone to hear.</p><p>&#x201c;Did you just say it&#x2019;s about Bigfoot?&#x201d; Pai Lu demanded, her words dripping with sarcasm.</p><p>Professor Fauna suddenly straightened up and looked very awkward. &#x201c;Er . . . ah . . . um . . .&#x201d; Everyone was staring at him. &#x201c;Yes!&#x201d; he said at last. &#x201c;I did say Bigfoot! My big foot. You see, my right foot is bigger than my left. On the bottom of that big foot I have a horrible wart.&#x201d; The children all gri�maced. &#x201c;It is very painful,&#x201d; the professor went on. &#x201c;And . . . and infected! So I need Elliot and Uchenna to help me!&#x201d;</p><p>Miss Vole looked confused. &#x201c;Why do you need Elliot and Uchenna to help you with your wart?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Right. Well . . . um . . . because . . . ,&#x201d; Profes�sor Fauna stammered. &#x201c;Because . . . I must drive to the doctor! But I cannot press upon the gas pedal because the wart is so painful! So one of them must do that for me while I drive. And . . . I have another wart on my thumb! So I cannot steer! So one of them will push the gas, and the other will steer, and I will sit in the driver&#x2019;s seat, telling them what to do.&#x201d;</p><p>Everyone stared at the professor, their mouths hanging open.</p><p>&#x201c;It is no problem,&#x201d; Professor Fauna added. &#x201c;We have done it before.&#x201d;</p><p>Finally, Miss Vole said, &#x201c;Professor, that doesn&#x2019;t make any sense.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;<i>�Mala palabra! </i>Am I not a teacher? Since when do teachers make sense? They are com�ing with me. Elliot, Uchenna, let&#x2019;s go.&#x201d; Then he looked around the room. &#x201c;Wait, where is Elliot?&#x201d;</p><p>Uchenna shrugged.</p><p>&#x201c;Come! <i>�V�monos! </i>We will find him on the way!&#x201d;</p><p>And with that, Professor Fauna turned and swept from the room. Uchenna hurried after him, glancing back at her class as she left.</p><p>Their mouths were still hanging open.</p><p>Then Jimmy farted the final two notes of &#x201c;Happy Birthday.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>CHAPTER TWO</b></p><p>Elliot Eisner poked his head out of the caf�eteria.</p><p>He looked to the right, in the direction of his classroom. There was no one in the hallway. Perfect.</p><p>By dawdling, hanging back, and, finally, hid�ing behind one of the big cafeteria doors, he had waited just long enough to avoid the crush of the morning crowd. Crowds made him nervous. Ac�tually, everything made him nervous. Even his best friend, Uchenna, made him nervous some�times.</p><p>To be clear: Uchenna was awesome. She knew a ton about music, she always dressed like the lead singer in a punk rock band, and she didn&#x2019;t even mind that he obsessively read books like <i>Deadly Beasts of Kazakhstan</i>. And <i>Scottish Poisonous Snakes</i>. And <i>The Ten Thousand Worst Ways to Die</i>, volumes 1, 2, and 4 (volume 3 was missing from the public library).</p><p>Of all the things that made Elliot nervous, though, there was something that made him more nervous than anything else.</p><p>Actually, not something. Some<i>one</i>.</p><p>Elliot looked to the right again, down the hall, and then to the left, in the direction of the stairs that led to the subbasement. It was all clear. That certain someone was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>Perhaps it was going to be a good day. Per�haps he was finally going to do only normal stuff. Learn about something boring, like commas or trees. Not about supposedly mythical creatures that turn out to be real, like Jersey Devils and vi�cious dragons with magical saliva.</p><p>Not today, Elliot thought. Please let this be a boring day.</p><p>He shouldered his backpack and stepped cautiously out into the hall. Still nothing.</p><p>He began to walk toward the classroom. His shoes squeaked on the newly waxed floor.</p><p>No mythical creatures, he thought. No evil billionaires, no hazardous quests, no plane crashes. And not <i>him</i>. Please, not <i>him</i>.</p><p>Elliot glanced behind, at the stairs to the subbasement. Still clear. He turned toward the door of his classroom&#x2014;</p><p><i>SMACK!</i></p><p>Elliot blinked. He was now staring at the ceil�ing, lying flat on the floor.</p><p>And <i>he </i>was looking down at Elliot. The one person in the world Elliot really did not want to see this morning. It was a wild-haired, black-and-white-bearded man with a very intense look on his face.</p><p>No, Elliot thought. Let this just be a bad dream. He closed his eyes, hoping that when he opened them again he would be waking up at home.</p><p>&#x201c;Elliot!&#x201d; Professor Fauna whispered. &#x201c;This is no time for a nap! Come on!&#x201d;</p><p>Elliot opened his eyes. Uchenna was grin�ning down at him.</p><p>She said, &#x201c;We&#x2019;re going to rescue Bigfoot.&#x201d;</p><p>Elliot closed his eyes again, sighed, and said, &#x201c;Of course.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>CHAPTER THREE</b></p><p>Professor Fauna pushed open the doors of the school and marched toward the parking lot.</p><p>&#x201c;Bigfoot?!&#x201d; Elliot said, trying to keep up. &#x201c;Se�riously? Bigfoot doesn&#x2019;t even exist! That myth has been debunked hundreds of times!&#x201d;</p><p>Uchenna was singing softly to herself:</p><p><i>What is a Bigfoot? </i></p><p><i>Do we even know? </i></p><p><i>In the deepest winter, </i></p><p><i>Is it white as fallen snow? </i></p><p><i>Living in the jungle, </i></p><p><i>Is it orange like an ape? </i></p><p><i>Hiding in your lunch box, </i></p><p><i>Is it purple like a grape? </i></p><p>Elliot looked at her. &#x201c;I have to admit,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;that was one of your better songs.&#x201d;</p><p>Uchenna grinned.</p><p>&#x201c;If Bigfoot is a myth, Elliot,&#x201d; Professor Fauna was saying, &#x201c;why did I just get a call from Mack geqideb?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Mack guh-kay-dub?&#x201d; said Uchenna, trying to pronounce the unfamiliar word. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s an unusual name.&#x201d;</p><p>The professor raised an eyebrow. &#x201c;You think so? I have known a number of people named Mack! There is even a tasty sandwich named that. Have you never heard of the Large Mack Donald?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think that&#x2019;s what it&#x2019;s called.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Anyway, Mack is a member of the Muckleshoot Indian Nation. His name, geqideb, in Muckleshoot means &#x2018;bright minded.&#x2019; His peo�ple live in the state of Washington. Now that is an unusual name, is it not? Washington? Why would someone name anything after two thou�sand pounds of laundry?&#x201d; Professor Fauna shook his head. &#x201c;Anyway, Mack and his family, like many of the Muckleshoot, are concerned about protecting the natural world . . . including crea�tures unrecognized by science!&#x201d;</p><p>They had come to Professor Fauna&#x2019;s blue-and-white airplane, the <i>Phoenix</i>. It was in its usual three parking spots, between Principal Kowalski&#x2019;s seafoam-green hatchback and Miss Vole&#x2019;s Harley motorcycle.</p><p>A shiver skittered down Elliot&#x2019;s back. It was not just that the <i>Phoenix </i>was scarred with rust and dents, or that its front window was spider-webbed with cracks. It wasn&#x2019;t even that on their last flight, the plane had crashed. It was that, as Professor Fauna happily admitted, the <i>Phoenix </i>crashed on every flight. But somehow the pro�fessor and his friends always got it flying again. Elliot wished they would stop doing that.</p><p>Professor Fauna flung open the passenger door of the small plane and helped Uchenna in. Elliot hung back. Inside the plane, Uchenna picked up a camouflage backpack with holes poked all over the main compartment. She un�zipped it. A small blue creature popped out. Its head looked like the head of a tiny deer. A tiny blue deer.</p><p>&#x201c;Hey, Jersey,&#x201d; said Uchenna.</p><p>Jersey, the Jersey Devil, stood up in the bag and spread his bright red wings. Then he licked Uchenna&#x2019;s face.</p><p>Uchenna looked through the open airplane door at Elliot. &#x201c;Aren&#x2019;t you coming?&#x201d;</p><p>Elliot was staring at the <i>Phoenix </i>like it was trying to kill him. Which, as far as he was con�cerned, it was.</p><p>Suddenly, Jersey leaped from Uchenna&#x2019;s arms and glided on outstretched wings over to Elliot. The little blue creature dug his claws into Elliot&#x2019;s shirt. Then he licked Elliot on the nose.</p><p>Elliot sighed.</p><p>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s do this thing.&#x201d;</p></p><h2>Skippyjon Jones Cirque de Ole</h2><p>The #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling kitty boy goes to the circus! <br><br>In his newest adventure, the irresistible Skippyjon Jones swings out of his closet and into the spectacular Cirque de Ole, where his pals, the Chimichango gang, perform feats of derring-do.

They have mastered the art of dealing with people! Let this book show you how to: Achieve your goals Handle the human ego Become a master conversationalist Make others feel good about themselves And much more! Skill with people is the one essential ingredient for success and happiness at home and in business. &#34;The Art of Dealing With People&#34; gives you the skills to take your people skills to a level that you never thought possible! Skill in human relations is similar to skill in any other field, in that success depends on understanding and mastering certain basic general principles. You must not only know what to do, but why you&#39;re doing it. As far as basic principles are concerned, people are all the same. Yet each individual person you meet is different. If you attempted to learn some gimmick to deal successfully with each separate individual you met, you would be face with a hopeless task. Influencing people is an art, not a gimmick. When you apply gimmicks in a superficial, mechanical manner, you go through the same motions as the person who &#34;has a way,&#34; but it doesn&#39;t work for you. The purpose of this book is to give you knowledge based upon an understanding of human nature: why people act the way they do. The methods presented in this book have been tested on thousands of people who have attended my human relations seminars. They are not just my pet ideas of how you should deal with people, but ideas that have stood the test of how you must deal with people. That is, if you want to get along with them and get what you want at the same time. Yes, we all want success and happiness. And the day is long past, if it ever existed, when you could achieve these goals by forcing people to give you what you want. And begging is no better, for no one has respect for, or any desire to help, the person who constantly kowtows and literally goes around with his hand out, begging other people to like him. The one successful way to get the things you want from life is to acquire skill in dealing with people.

Your idea of success may be different from mine. But there is one big factor which all of us must learn to deal with if we are to be successful and happy. The one common denominator to all success and happiness is other people. </p><p>Various scientific studies have proven that if you learn how to deal with other people, you will have gone 85% of the way down the road to success in any business, occupation, or profession, and about 99% of the way to personal happiness. </p><p>Merely getting along isn't the answer. What counts is a way to deal with people that will bring us personal satisfaction and, at the same time, not trample on others' egos. Human relations is the science of dealing with people in such a way that our egos and their egos remain intact. And this is the only method of getting along with people that ever results in any real success or satisfaction. </p><p>The reason 90% of people fail in life is a failure to deal successfully with people. Look around you. Are the most successful people those with the most brains, the most skill? Are the people who are the happiest and get the most fun out of life so much smarter than the other people you know? If you will stop and think a moment, the chances are that you will say that the people you know who are the most successful, and enjoy life the most, are those who "have a way" with people. </p><p>Your personality problems are your problems with other people. There are millions of people today who are self-conscious, shy, and ill-at-ease in social situations. They feel inferior and never realize that their real problem is a human relations problem. It never seems to get across to them that their failure as a personality is a failure in learning to deal successfully with people. </p><p>There are almost as many who, at least on the surface, seem to be the very opposite of the shy, retiring type. They appear to be self-assured. They are "bossy" and dominate any social situation they are in, whether it is the home, the office, or the club. Yet they, too, realize that something is missing. They wonder why their employees or their families do not appreciate them. They wonder why people do not cooperate more willingly; why it is necessary to continually force people into line. And, most of all, they realize in their more candid moments, that the people they are most anxious to impress never really give them the approval and acceptance they crave. They attempt to force cooperation, loyalty and friendship; to push people to produce for them. But, the one thing they cannot force is the thing they want the most: they cannot force people to like them. They never really get what they want because they have never mastered the art of dealing with people.</p><p> </p><p>Whether we like it or not, people are here to stay. In our modern world, we simply cannot achieve any success or happiness without taking other people into account. The doctor, the lawyer, the salesperson who enjoys the most success is not necessarily the one who is the most intelligent or the the most skillful in the mechanics of his or her job. The husband and wife who are the happiest are not the ones who are the most attractive. Look for a success in any endeavor and you will find someone who has mastered the knack of dealing with people... a person who has a "way" with others. </p><p>Skill in human relations is similar to skill in any other field, in that success depends on understanding and mastering certain basic general principles. You must not only know what to do, but why you're doing it. </p><p>As far as basic principles are concerned, people are all the same. Yet each individual person you meet is different. If you attempted to learn some gimmick to deal successfully with each separate individual you met, you would be face with a hopeless task. </p><p>Influencing people is an art, not a gimmick. When you apply gimmicks in a superficial, mechanical manner, you go through the same motions as the person who "has a way," but it doesn't work for you. </p><p>The purpose of this book is to give you knowledge based upon an understanding of human nature: why people act the way they do. The methods presented in this book have been tested on thousands of people who have attended my human relations seminars. They are not just my pet ideas of how you should deal with people, but ideas that have stood the test of how you must deal with people. That is, if you want to get along with them and get what you want at the same time. </p><p>Yes, we all want success and happiness. And the day is long past, if it ever existed, when you could achieve these goals by forcing people to give you what you want. And begging is no better, for no one has respect for, or any desire to help, the person who constantly kowtows and literally goes around with his hand out, begging other people to like him. </p><p>The one successful way to get the things you want from life is to acquire skill in dealing with people.

Wattles: (9 BOOKS) The Science of Getting Rich; The Science of Being Great;The Science of Being Well; How to Get What You ... Harrison (novel) (Timeless Wisdom Collection)</h2><p>This volume contains the complete collection of Wallace D. Wattles writings, one of the most influential authors of the New Thought, who inspired modern books like &#x201c;The Secret&#x201d;.Wallace sought a complete human being, healthy, purposeful, living in harmony with family and peers, and rich enough to enjoy ALL that is good in life. He saw men and women able to enjoy the things the Universal Source (God) has made available to all, if only we would follow basic rules that HE -over and over and over again throughout history, has tried to communicate via Messages and Messengers. The Wisdom of Wallace, his philosophy and his way of expressing it, are a universal treasure that could certainly contribute to getting us closer to the eternal truth. The truth that there is SOMETHING beyond our understanding which we call many names, and is in all things and in all of us, whether we are rich or poor, religious or not religious.</p><p>Shortly after his death, Florence Wattles, Wallace&#x2019;s daughter, wrote this letter to Elizabeth Towne, that helps to provide some insights onto Wallace&#x2019;s life: "You knew, didn't you, that he lost a good position in the Methodist Church because of his &#x201c;heresy&#x201d;? He met George D. Herron at a convention of reformers in Chicago in 1896 and caught Herron's social vision. I shall never forget the morning he came home. It was Christmas. Mother had put her last dollar into a cuff box and we had placed it beneath an evergreen branch which served for our Christmas tree and which we had illumined with tallow candles and strung with popcorn. Finally Father came. With that beautiful smile he praised the tree, said the cuff box was just what he had been wanting&#x2014;and took us all in his arms to tell us of the wonderful social message of Jesus, the message which he later embodied in &#x201c;A New Christ.&#x201d; From that day until his death he worked unceasingly to realize the glorious vision of human brotherhood. For years his life was cursed by poverty and the fear of poverty. He was always scheming and planning to get for his family those things which make the abundant life possible. In the first chapter of &#x201c;How to be a Genius&#x201d; he says: &#x201c;Man's greatest happiness is found in the bestowal of benefits on those he loves.&#x201d; The supreme faith of the man never left him; never for a moment did he lose confidence in the power of the master Intelligence to right every wrong and to give to every man and woman his or her share of the good things of life. When we came to Elwood (Indiana) three years ago, Father began a Sunday night lectureship in Indianapolis. This was our only source of income. Later he began to write for Nautilus and to work out his own philosophy. He wrote almost constantly. Then it was that he formed his mental picture. He saw himself as a successful writer, a personality of power, an advancing man, and he began to work toward the realization of this vision. ... He lived every page of &#x201c;How to be a Genius.&#x201d; In the last three years he made lots of money, and had good health except for his extreme frailty. I have written this hurriedly, but I think it will give you an idea of the life struggle of a great man &#x2014;his failure and success. His life was truly THE POWERFUL LIFE, and surely we can say, at least in Elwood, &#x201c;The name of him who loved his fellow men led all the rest.&#x201d; With all good wishes, I am, Very sincerely, FLORENCE A.

Only now we were adults, and that connection had grown to a spark. Our letters quickly went from fun to flirty to downright dirty, revealing our wildest fantasies.

But what exactly happens after you flush? Where does our waste go, and how is it made safe? With his unique blend of informative text and illustration, David Macaulay takes readers on a tour of the bathroom and the sewer system, from the familiar family toilet to the mysterious municipal water treatment plant. <br>A <i>Kirkus Reviews</i> Best Book of 2013</p></p><p><p><b>David Macaulay</b> received his bachelor of architecture degree from Rhode Island School of Design. In January 1973, Macaulay went to France to work on the first of his twenty-five books,<i> Cathedral</i>. He then constructed a colonial Roman town (<i>City</i>, 1974), erected monuments to the Pharaohs (Pyramid, 1975), dissected the maze of subterranean systems below and essential to every major city (<i>Underground</i>, 1976), built a medieval fortress (<i>Castle</i>, 1977), and dismantled the Empire State Building (<i>Unbuilding</i>, 1980). Macaulay is perhaps best known for <i>The Way Things Work</i> (1988). It was followed by <i>Black and White</i> (1990) for which he won the 1991 Caldecott Medal. A revised edition of <i>The Way Things Work</i> was published in 1998 followed by <i>Building Big</i>, <i>Mosque</i>, and most recently, <i>The Way We Work</i> (2008).</p>Toilets&#x2014;our most fascinating home device? Probably&#x2014;it&#x2019;s rather magical how everything just disappears, isn&#x2019;t it? In his signature squiggly style, Macaulay pulls back the curtain to show just how it all goes down (so to speak). Whether it&#x2019;s the family dog&#x2019;s bone, a dead goldfish, or human waste, the toilet makes it disappear. &#x201c;Clever toilet.&#x201d; The main event here is the authors&#x2019; annotated cutaways of toilets, showing how the handle pulls the stopper and so forth. Despite the easily understandable text, some concepts remain a bit elusive, though things get clearer and even more interesting when we move on to rural septic tanks, big-city sewer systems, and wastewaster treatment plants. Boldfaced vocabulary words would&#x2019;ve helped readers refer to the closing glossary (though some intriguing words, like scum and digester, aren&#x2019;t defined). While not as successful as Castle: How It Works (2012), this is high-interest stuff done in a just-humorous-enough way. Pair with Elizabeth Raum&#x2019;s The Story behind Toilets (2009) for some extended bathroom reading.

It&#x2019;s not even twice upon a time. It&#x2019;s hundreds of times, over and over, every time someone opens up the pages of this dusty old book.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oliver,&#x201d; my best friend says. &#x201c;Checkmate.&#x201d;<br> <br>I follow Frump&#x2019;s gaze and stare down at the chessboard, which isn&#x2019;t really a chessboard at all. It&#x2019;s just squares scratched onto the sand of Everafter Beach, and a bunch of accommodating fairies who don&#x2019;t mind acting as pawns and bishops and queens. There isn&#x2019;t a chess set in the story, so we have to make do with what we&#x2019;ve got, and of course we have to clean up all evidence when we&#x2019;re done, or else someone might assume that there is more to the story than what they know.<br> <br><br> <br>I can&#x2019;t remember when I first realized that life, as I knew it, wasn&#x2019;t real. That this role I performed over and over was just that&#x2014;a role. And that in order for me to play it, there had to be another party involved&#x2014;namely one of those large, round, flat faces that blurred the sky above us every time the story began. The relationships you see on the page aren&#x2019;t always as they seem. When we&#x2019;re not acting our parts, we&#x2019;re all just free to go about our business. It&#x2019;s quite complicated, really. I&#x2019;m Prince Oliver, but I&#x2019;m not Prince Oliver. When the book is closed, I can stop pretending that I&#x2019;m interested in Seraphima or that I&#x2019;m fighting a dragon, and instead I can hang out with Frump or taste the concoctions Queen Maureen likes to dream up in the kitchen or take a dip in the ocean with the pirates, who are actually quite nice fellows. In other words, we all have lives outside the lives that we play when a Reader opens the book. For everyone else here, that knowledge is enough. They&#x2019;re happy repeating the story endlessly, and staying trapped onstage even when the Readers are gone. But me, I&#x2019;ve always wondered. It stands to reason that if I have a life outside of this story, so do the Readers whose faces float above us. And they&#x2019;re not trapped inside the book. So where exactly are they? And what do they do when the book is closed?<br> <br>Once, a Reader&#x2014;a very young one&#x2014;knocked the book over and it fell open on a page that has no one but me written into it. For a full hour, I watched the Other-world go by. These giants stacked bricks made of wood, with letters written on their sides, creating monstrous buildings. They dug their hands into a deep table filled with the same sort of sand we have on Everafter Beach. They stood in front of easels, like the one Rapscullio likes to use when he paints, but these artists used a unique style&#x2014;dipping their hands into the paint and smearing it across the paper in swirls of color. Finally, one of the Others, who looked to be as old as Queen Maureen, leaned forward and frowned. &#x201c;Children! This is not how we treat books,&#x201d; she said, before shutting me out.<br> <br>When I told the others what I had seen, they just shrugged. Queen Maureen suggested I see Orville about my strange dreams and ask for a sleeping potion. Frump, who is my best friend both inside the story and out, believed me. &#x201c;What difference does it make, Oliver?&#x201d; he asked. &#x201c;Why waste time and energy thinking about a place or a person you&#x2019;ll never be?&#x201d; Immediately I regretted bringing it up. Frump wasn&#x2019;t always a dog&#x2014;he was written into the story as Figgins, my best buddy from childhood, who was transformed by Rapscullio into a common hound. Because it&#x2019;s only a flashback of text, the only time he&#x2019;s ever read he&#x2019;s seen as a dog&#x2014;which is why he stays in that form even when we&#x2019;re offstage.<br> <br>Frump captures my queen. &#x201c;Checkmate,&#x201d; he says.<br> <br>&#x201c;Why do you always beat me?&#x201d; I sigh.<br> <br>&#x201c;Why do you always let me?&#x201d; Frump says, and he scratches behind his ear. &#x201c;Stupid fleas.&#x201d;<br> <br>When we&#x2019;re working, Frump doesn&#x2019;t speak&#x2014;he just barks. He follows me around like, well, a faithful pup. You&#x2019;d never guess, when he&#x2019;s acting, that in real life he&#x2019;s always bossing the rest of us around.<br> <br>&#x201c;I think I saw a tear at the top of page forty-seven,&#x201d; I say as casually as I can, although I&#x2019;ve been thinking of nothing but getting back there to investigate since first spotting it. &#x201c;Want to come check it out?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Honestly, Oliver. Not that again.&#x201d; Frump rolls his eyes. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re like a one-trick pony.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Did you call me?&#x201d; Socks trots closer. He&#x2019;s my trusty steed, and again, a shining example of how what you see isn&#x2019;t always what&#x2019;s true. Although he snorts and stamps with the confidence of a stallion on the pages of our world, when the book is closed he&#x2019;s a nervous mess with the self-confidence of a gnat.<br> <br>I smile at him, because if I don&#x2019;t, he&#x2019;s going to think I&#x2019;m angry at him. He&#x2019;s that sensitive. &#x201c;No, we didn&#x2019;t...&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I distinctly heard the word pony...&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It was just an expression,&#x201d; Frump says.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, now that I&#x2019;m here, tell me the truth,&#x201d; Socks says, turning in a half circle. &#x201c;This saddle totally makes my butt look fat, doesn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; I say immediately, as Frump vigorously shakes his head.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re all muscle,&#x201d; Frump says. &#x201c;In fact, I was going to ask if you&#x2019;d been working out.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re just saying that to make me feel better.&#x201d; Socks sniffles. &#x201c;I knew I shouldn&#x2019;t have had that last carrot at breakfast.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You look great, Socks,&#x201d; I insist. &#x201c;Honestly.&#x201d; But he tosses his mane and sulks back toward the other side of the beach.<br> <br>Frump rolls onto his back. &#x201c;If I have to listen to that stupid horse whine one more time&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s exactly what I&#x2019;m talking about,&#x201d; I interrupt. &#x201c;What if you didn&#x2019;t have to? What if you could be anywhere&#x2014;anything&#x2014;you wanted to be?&#x201d;<br> <br>I have this dream. It&#x2019;s kind of silly, but I see myself walking down a street I&#x2019;ve never seen before, in a village I can&#x2019;t identify. A girl hurries past me, her dark hair whipping behind her like a flag, and in her haste she crashes into me. When I reach out to help her up, I feel a spark ignite between us. Her eyes are the color of honey, and I cannot turn away from them. Finally, I say, and when I kiss her, she tastes of mint and winter and nothing like Seraphima&#x2014;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah, right,&#x201d; Frump says, interrupting me. &#x201c;How many career opportunities are there for a basset hound?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re only a dog because you were written that way,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;What if you could change that?&#x201d;<br> <br>He laughs. &#x201c;Change it. Change the story. Yeah, that&#x2019;s a good one, Ollie. While you&#x2019;re at it, why don&#x2019;t you turn the ocean into grape juice and make the mermaids fly?&#x201d;<br> <br>Maybe he&#x2019;s right, maybe it is just me. Everyone else in this book seems to be perfectly happy with the fact that they are part of a story; that they are enslaved into doing and saying the same things over and over, like in a play that gets performed for eternity. They probably think that the people in the Otherworld have the same sorts of lives we do. I guess I find it hard to believe that Readers get up at the same hour every morning and eat the same breakfast every day and go sit in the same chair for hours and have the same conversations with their parents and go to bed and wake up and do it all over again. I think more likely they lead the most incredible lives&#x2014;and by incredible, I mean: with free will. I wonder all the time what that would be like: to feel the book opening yet not beg the queen to let me go on a quest. To avoid getting trapped by fairies and run ragged by a villain. To fall in love with a girl whose eyes are the color of honey. To see someone I don&#x2019;t recognize, and whose name I don&#x2019;t know. I&#x2019;m not fussy, really. I wouldn&#x2019;t mind being a butcher instead of a prince. Or swimming across the ocean to be hailed as a legendary athlete. Or picking a fight with someone who cuts in front of me. I wouldn&#x2019;t mind doing anything other than the same old things I have done for as long as I can remember. I guess I just have to believe there&#x2019;s more to the world than what&#x2019;s inside these pages. Or maybe it&#x2019;s just that I desperately want to believe that.<br> <br>I glance around at the others. Between readings, our real personalities show. One of the trolls is working out a melody on a flute he has carved from a piece of bamboo. The fairies are doing crossword puzzles that Captain Crabbe creates for them, but they keep cheating by looking into the wizard&#x2019;s crystal ball. And Seraphima...<br> <br>She blows me a kiss, and I force a smile.<br> <br><br> <br>She&#x2019;s pretty, I suppose, with her silver hair and eyes the color of violets in the meadow near the castle. But her shoe size is bigger than her IQ. For example, she honestly believes that just because I save her over and over again as part of my job, I must truly have feelings for her.<br> <br>I&#x2019;ll be honest, it&#x2019;s not a hard day&#x2019;s work to kiss a beautiful girl repeatedly. But it all starts feeling same old, same old after a while. I certainly don&#x2019;t love Seraphima, but that little detail seems to have escaped her. Which makes me feel guilty every time I kiss her, because I know she wants more from me than I&#x2019;m ever going to give her when the storybook&#x2019;s closed.<br> <br>Beside me, Frump lets out a long, mournful howl. That&#x2019;s the second reason I feel so guilty kissing Seraphima. He&#x2019;s had a crush on her for as long as I can remember, and that makes it even worse. What must it be like, watching me pretend to fall in love with the girl he&#x2019;s crazy about, day after day? &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, buddy,&#x201d; I say to him. &#x201c;I wish she knew it was just for show.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Not your fault,&#x201d; he replies tightly. &#x201c;Just doing what you have to do.&#x201d;<br> <br>As if he&#x2019;s conjured it, there is suddenly a blinding light, and our sky cracks open along a seam. &#x201c;Places!&#x201d; Frump cries, frantic. &#x201c;Everyone! Into your positions!&#x201d; He runs off to help the trolls dismantle the bridge, only so that they can rebuild it again.<br> <br>I grab my tunic and my dagger. The fairies who were our chess pieces rise like sparks and write the words SEE YOU LATER in the air before me, a trail of light as they zoom into the woods. &#x201c;Yes, and thanks again,&#x201d; I say politely, intent on hurrying to the castle for my first scene.<br> <br>What would happen, I wonder, if I was late? If I dawdled or stopped to smell the lilacs at the castle gate, so that I wasn&#x2019;t in place when the book was opened? Would it stay sealed shut? Or would the story start without me?<br> <br>Experimentally, I slow my pace, dragging my heels. But suddenly I feel a magnetic tug on the front of my tunic, propelling me through the pages. They rustle as I leap through them, my legs moving in double time while I stare down, amazed. I can hear Socks whinnying in his stall at the royal stables, and the splash of the mermaids as they dive back into the sea, and suddenly, I am standing where I am supposed to be, before the royal throne in the Great Hall, at dispute court. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s about time,&#x201d; Frump mutters. At the last moment there is a brilliant slice of light that opens above us, and instead of looking away like we usually do, this time I glance up.<br> <br>I can see the Reader&#x2019;s face&#x2014;a little fuzzy at the edges, sort of how the sun looks from the ocean floor. And just like when one stares at the sun, I can&#x2019;t make myself turn away.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oliver!&#x201d; Frump hisses. &#x201c;Focus!&#x201d;<br> <br>So I turn away from those eyes, the exact color of honey; from that mouth, its lips parted just the tiniest bit, as if she might be about to speak my name. I turn away, and clear my throat, and for the hundred billionth time in my life, I speak my first line of the story.<br> <br>Save who?<br> <br>I did not write the lines I speak; they were given to me long before I remember. I mouth the words, but the actual sound is in the Reader&#x2019;s mind, not coming from my throat. Similarly, all the moves that we make as if we&#x2019;re performing a play somehow unravel across someone else&#x2019;s imagination. It is as if the action and sound on our tiny, remote stage are being broadcast in the thoughts of the Reader. I&#x2019;m not sure that I ever really learned this information&#x2014;it&#x2019;s just something I&#x2019;ve known forever, the same way I know that when I look at the grass and associate it with a color, I know that color is green.<br> <br>I let Rapscullio convince me that he is a nobleman from afar whose beloved daughter has been kidnapped&#x2014;a speech I&#x2019;ve heard so often that occasionally, I murmur the words along with him. In the story, of course, he has no daughter. He&#x2019;s just setting a trap for me. But I&#x2019;m not supposed to know that yet, even though I&#x2019;ve played this scene a thousand times. So while he is going on and on about the other princes who won&#x2019;t rescue Seraphima, I think about the girl who is reading us.<br> <br>I&#x2019;ve seen her before. She&#x2019;s different from our usual Readers&#x2014;they&#x2019;re either motherly, like Queen Maureen, or young enough to be captivated by tales of princesses in peril. But this Reader looks&#x2014;well, she looks to be about my age. It doesn&#x2019;t make any sense. Surely she knows&#x2014;like I do&#x2014;that fairy tales are just stories. That happy endings aren&#x2019;t real.<br> <br>Frump waddles across the polished black-and-white marble floor, his tail wagging vigorously as he skids to a halt beside me.<br> <br>Suddenly I hear a voice&#x2014;distant, through a tunnel, but clear enough: &#x201c;Delilah, I told you twice already... we&#x2019;re going to be late!&#x201d;<br> <br>From time to time, I&#x2019;ve heard Readers talking. They don&#x2019;t usually read out loud, but every now and then, a conversation occurs when a book is open. I&#x2019;ve learned quite a lot from being a good listener. Like, for example, Don&#x2019;t let the bedbugs bite is apparently a common way to say good night, even in rooms that do not appear to be infested with insects. I&#x2019;ve learned about things the Otherworld has that we don&#x2019;t: television (which is something parents do not like as much as books); Happy Meals (apparently not all meals bring joy. Just the ones that come in a paper bag with a small toy); and showers (something you take before bedtime that leaves you drenched).<br> <br>&#x201c;Just let me finish,&#x201d; the girl says.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve read that book a thousand times&#x2014;you know how it ends. Now means now!&#x201d;<br> <br>I have heard this Reader speaking to the older woman before. From their conversations, I&#x2019;m guessing it&#x2019;s her mother. She is always telling Delilah to put the book away and go outside. To take a walk and get some fresh air. To call a friend (though how many could be within earshot?) and go to a movie (whatever that is). Repeatedly, I wait for her to heed her mother&#x2019;s directions&#x2014;but most of the time she finds an excuse to keep reading. Sometimes she does go outside, but opens the book and starts reading again. I cannot tell you how frustrating this is for me. Here I am, wasting away inside a book I wish I could escape, and all she wants to do is stay in the story.<br> <br>If I could talk to this girl Delilah, I&#x2019;d ask her why on earth she would ever trade a single second of the world she&#x2019;s in for the one in which I&#x2019;m stuck.<br> <br>But I&#x2019;ve tried talking out loud to other Readers. Believe me, it was the very first thing I attempted when I started to actively dream about life in the Otherworld. If I could just get one of those people holding the book to notice me, maybe I&#x2019;d have a chance at escaping. However, the people holding the book see me only when the story is playing, and when the story is playing, I am compelled to stick to the script. Even when I try to say something like &#x201c;Please! Listen to me!&#x201d; I wind up announcing, instead, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m on my way to rescue a princess!&#x201d; like some sort of puppet. If I ever had reason to believe that a Reader could see me for who I really am&#x2014;not who I play in the story&#x2014;I&#x2019;d do, well, anything. I&#x2019;d scream at the top of my lungs. I&#x2019;d run in circles. I&#x2019;d light myself on fire. Anything, to keep her se...</p><h2>Mayo Clinic on Digestive 4th Ed: How to Prevent and Treat Common Stomach and Gut Problems</h2><p>Digestive problems are among the most common reasons people see their doctors.

Boy Without Instructions changes that.Williams shares her unfiltered thoughts and emotions during her progression through this learning curve during this harrowing ride. Right before your eyes, this initially grief-stricken momma transforms from obsessed-with-ADHD control-freak and helicopter mom to optimistic and (mostly) confident parent of a child who happens to have ADHD. Boy Without Instructions validates your grief and guilt, yet reveals that it&#x2019;s truly possible to craft a (mostly) joy-filled life for your child with ADHD, yourself, and your family.</p><p>I am one of those "fix it" types of mommas -- fix the boo-boos, fix the hurt feelings, fix whatever causes my children any pain. When my son, Ricochet, was diagnosed with ADHD in 2008, at just six years old, I was devastated. There's no "fix" for ADHD. It took me more than two years to figure it out -- there's no magic bullet for ADHD either, and obsessing about finding one can only make things worse. I realized a few years after diagnosis, that there is quite a learning curve to parenting a child with ADHD, and I was finally getting to the long, (mostly) even stretch at the end of it.&nbsp;<br> Parents of children with ADHD are given a diagnosis, handed a prescription, and pushed back out into the world without any guidance, and certainly without instructions. "Call us if the medication doesn't prove beneficial," they might offer. It's my mission to help parents of children with ADHD learn how to get to know their children needs meaningfully so they can guide them to a happy and success future. I want to use my joy and pain in my learning curve to help others on this journey experience it with more joy and less pain.&nbsp;A self-described "veteran" parent of a son with ADHD, Penny Williams is the author of the award-winning, Amazon best-seller about her parenthood in the trenches,&nbsp;<i>Boy Without Instructions: Surviving the Learning Curve of Parenting a Child with ADHD,&nbsp;</i>and author of the award-winning<i>&nbsp;What to Expect When You're Not Expecting ADHD.</i>&nbsp;She is also a frequent contributor on parenting a child with ADHD for&nbsp;<i>ADDitude Magazine, Healthline</i>&nbsp;and other parenting and special needs publications.

"I share my experiences parenting my son, Ricochet, in the hopes of shortening that painful time of trial by fire for others."

Paula grew up in the deep south, in a world where whites had and blacks did not. With an activist father and a community of leaders surrounding her, including Uncle Martin (Martin Luther King), Paula watched and listened to the struggles, eventually joining with her family&#x2014;and thousands of others&#x2014;in the historic march from Selma to Montgomery.<br> <br> Poignant, moving, and hopeful, this is an intimate look at the birth of the Civil Rights Movement.</p><p><strong>A Conversation Between Author Paula Young Shelton and Illustrator Raul Col�n</strong> <br> <p>We asked author Paula Young Shelton and illustrator Raul Col�n to talk about <em>Child of the Civil Rights Movement</em>, Shelton's poignant and hopeful story of growing up in the midst of the Civil Rights Movement. Paula Young Shelton is the daughter of civil rights leader and former U.N. ambassador Andrew Young. She is a teacher in Washington, D.C., and a member of the National Black Child Development Institute. Raul Col�n's work has appeared in numerous publications, but he is especially renowned for his children&#x2019;s book illustrations, including <em>My Mama Had A Dancing Heart</em>, <em>Sugar Cane: A Caribbean Rapunzel</em>, <em>Angela and the Baby Jesus</em>, and <em>As Good as Anybody</em>. Read on to discover how Paula and Raul worked together to capture, through words and images, a pivotal moment in American history.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Raul Col�n:</strong> Why did you write the book in the first place?</p> <p><strong>Paula Young Shelton:</strong> I got the idea for this book after telling my students stories about the civil rights movement as part of our study of Martin Luther King. They became so interested in hearing about my "Uncle Martin" that I realized it was a good way for young people to connect with Dr. King, and I started writing the stories down.</p> <p><strong>Raul Col�n:</strong> Have you written any others before or since?</p> <p><strong>Paula Young Shelton:</strong> I have always loved to write and have written quite a few "yet to be published" stories. My first book was actually written as my master's thesis and I've got a few stories brewing now, so I hope to keep writing.</p> <p><strong>Raul Col�n:</strong> Did you interview your family or any other folks to refresh your memory, since it all happened during your early childhood?</p> <p><strong>Paula Young Shelton:</strong> Absolutely, I talked a lot to my sisters about their memories and, of course, my dad.</p> <p><strong>Raul Col�n:</strong> What was the procedure you followed in order to make time to write this story? Did you wake up early, or did you write at all times, say while you rode the train, etc.?</p> <p><strong>Paula Young Shelton:</strong> As a teacher, I get the summers off, so I did the majority of writing during the summer, when I can focus on it for long periods. With three kids, a husband, and a job, it's sometimes hard to find the time to write, so during the year I would write late at night, when the house is quiet. I'm more of a night owl than early bird.</p> <p><strong>Raul Col�n:</strong> You seem ready for another picture book. How much did you enjoy this experience?</p> <p><strong>Paula Young Shelton:</strong> It has been a real thrill! All the things I dreaded, like working with an editor or an illustrator I didn't know, turned out to be great experiences. The editor, Anne Schwartz, was incredible and made me really appreciate watching her cut my work to pieces. She helped me to focus the story and really made it flow nicely. <br></p> <p>As for the illustrator, I was blown away by the pictures you produced. Some of them were exactly how I had envisioned them in my mind's eye, and others were more beautiful than I could have imagined. I can't wait to do it all over again!</p> Raul, everyone loves the picture of the crow and it is such a powerful image. What made you draw the picture of the huge crow above the little girl's head like that? <p></p> <p><strong>Raul Col�n:</strong> Initially I had thought of drawing a mean-looking face. But looking through some art book I had, I saw some interesting pictures of black crows and decided to use the visual pun for this piece.</p> <p><strong>Paula Young Shelton:</strong> Besides, of course, my book, what has been your favorite book to illustrate, and why?</p> <p><strong>Raul Col�n:</strong> Besides your book, I have quite a few others I truly enjoyed. But I must say that the most significant book I illustrated was my first one, <em>Always My Dad</em>. It won accolades and awards, and opened up the floodgates.</p> <p><strong>Paula Young Shelton:</strong> You've illustrated a few books on civil rights issues. Is that your choice, or just a coincidence?</p> <p><strong>Raul Col�n:</strong> I did these books on Civil Rights but it was just a matter of timing. A coincidence.</p> <p><strong>Paula Young Shelton:</strong> I love the scratching effect in your artwork. How do you do that?</p> <p><strong>Raul Col�n:</strong> I use a very "sophisticated" instrument called a Scratcher(TM), believe it or not. I etch the paper before I add the final layers of color.</p> <p><strong>Paula Young Shelton:</strong> I get such a great response to the book because of the amazing pictures. Would you illustrate my next book?</p> <p><strong>Raul Col�n:</strong> Send the manuscript.</p>Paula Young Shelton is the daughter of civil rights leader and former U.N. ambassador Andrew Young.

Now Martin E. P. Seligman, the best-selling author of Learned Optimism, and his colleagues offer parents and educators a program clinically proven to cut that risk in half. With this startling new research, parents can teach children to apply optimism skills that can curb depression, boost school performance, and improve physical health. These skills provide children with the resilience they need to approach the teenage years and adulthood with confidence. Over the last thirty years the self-esteem movement has infiltrated American homes and classrooms with the credo that supplying positive feedback, regardless of the quality of performance, will make children feel better about themselves. But in this era of raising our children to feel good, the hard truth is that they have never been more depressed.

Moreover, there are competing voices today claiming the mantle of &#x201c;true conservatism&#x201d;&#x2014;including neo-conservatism (emphasis on a robust national security), paleo-conservatism (emphasis on preserving the culture), social conservatism (emphasis on faith and values), and libertarianism (emphasis on individualism), among others. Scores of scholars have written at length about what can be imperfectly characterized as conservative thought. But my purpose is not to give them each exposition, as it cannot be fairly or adequately accomplished here, nor referee among them. Neither will I attempt to give birth to totally new theories.<br> <br>Instead, what follows are my own opinions and conclusions of fundamental truths, based on decades of observation, exploration, and experience, about conservatism and, conversely, nonconservatism&#x2014;that is, liberty and tyranny in modern America.<br> <br>To put it succinctly: Conservatism is a way of understanding life, society, and governance. The Founders were heavily influenced by certain philosophers, among them Adam Smith (spontaneous order), Charles Montesquieu (separation of powers), and especially John Locke (natural rights); they were also influenced by their faiths, personal experiences, and knowledge of history (including the rise and fall of the Roman Empire). Edmund Burke, who was both a British statesman and thinker, is often said to be the father of modern conservatism. He was an early defender of the American Revolution and advocate of representative government. He wrote of the interconnection of liberty, free markets, religion, tradition, and authority. The Conservative, like the Founders, is informed by all these great thinkers&#x2014;and more.<br> <br>The Declaration of Independence represents the most prominent, official, consensus position of the Founders&#x2019; rationale for declaring independence from England. It states, in part,<br><br>When in the Course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature&#x2019;s God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation. We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness....<br><br>The Founders believed, and the Conservative agrees, in the dignity of the individual; that we, as human beings, have a right to live, live freely, and pursue that which motivates us not because man or some government says so, but because these are God-given natural rights.<br> <br>Like the Founders, the Conservative also recognizes in society a harmony of interests,1 as Adam Smith put it, and rules of cooperation that have developed through generations of human experience and collective reasoning that promote the betterment of the individual and society. This is characterized as ordered liberty, the social contract, or the civil society.<br> <br>What are the conditions of this civil society?<br> <br>In the civil society, the individual is recognized and accepted as more than an abstract statistic or faceless member of some group; rather, he is a unique, spiritual being with a soul and a conscience. He is free to discover his own potential and pursue his own legitimate interests, tempered, however, by a moral order that has its foundation in faith and guides his life and all human life through the prudent exercise of judgment. As such, the individual in the civil society strives, albeit imperfectly, to be virtuous&#x2014;that is, restrained, ethical, and honorable. He rejects the relativism that blurs the lines between good and bad, right and wrong, just and unjust, and means and ends.<br> <br>In the civil society, the individual has a duty to respect the unalienable rights of others and the values, customs, and traditions, tried and tested over time and passed from one generation to the next, that establish society&#x2019;s cultural identity. He is responsible for attending to his own well-being and that of his family. And he has a duty as a citizen to contribute voluntarily to the welfare of his community through good works.<br> <br>In the civil society, private property and liberty are inseparable. The individual&#x2019;s right to live freely and safely and pursue happiness includes the right to acquire and possess property, which represents the fruits of his own intellectual and/or physical labor. As the individual&#x2019;s time on earth is finite, so, too, is his labor. The illegitimate denial or diminution of his private property enslaves him to another and denies him his liberty.<br> <br>In the civil society, a rule of law, which is just, known, and predictable, and applied equally albeit imperfectly, provides the governing framework for and restraints on the polity, thereby nurturing the civil society and serving as a check against the arbitrary use and, hence, abuse of power.2<br> <br>For the Conservative, the civil society has as its highest purpose its preservation and improvement.3<br> <br>The Modern Liberal believes in the supremacy of the state, thereby rejecting the principles of the Declaration and the order of the civil society, in whole or part. For the Modern Liberal, the individual&#x2019;s imperfection and personal pursuits impede the objective of a utopian state. In this, Modern Liberalism promotes what French historian Alexis de Tocqueville described as a soft tyranny,4 which becomes increasingly more oppressive, potentially leading to a hard tyranny (some form of totalitarianism). As the word &#x201c;liberal&#x201d; is, in its classical meaning, the opposite of authoritarian, it is more accurate, therefore, to characterize the Modern Liberal as a Statist.<br> <br>The Founders understood that the greatest threat to liberty is an all-powerful central government, where the few dictate to the many. They also knew that the rule of the mob would lead to anarchy and, in the end, despotism. During the Revolutionary War, the states more or less followed the Articles of Confederation, in which most governing authority remained with the states. After the war, as the Founders labored to establish a new nation, the defects with the Articles became increasingly apparent. The central government did not have the ability to fund itself. Moreover, states were issuing their own currency, conducting their own foreign policy, and raising their own armies. Trade disputes among the states and with other countries were hampering commerce and threatening national prosperity.<br> <br>Eventually the Articles were replaced with the Constitution, which granted the federal government enough authority to cultivate, promote, and &#x201c;secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity,&#x201d;5 but not enough authority to destroy it all. James Madison, the most influential of the Constitution&#x2019;s authors, put it best when he wrote in &#x201c;Federalist 51&#x201d;:<br><br>But what is government itself, but the greatest of all reflections on human nature? If men were angels, no government would be necessary. If angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal controls on government would be necessary. In framing a government which is to be administered by men over men, the great difficulty lies in this: you must first enable the government to control the governed; and in the next place oblige it to control itself.6<br><br>For much of American history, the balance between governmental authority and individual liberty was understood and accepted. Federal power was confined to that which was specifically enumerated in the Constitution and no more. And that power was further limited, for it was dispersed among three federal branches&#x2014;the legislative, executive, and judicial. Beyond that, the power remained with the states and ultimately the people.<br> <br>The Framers recognized that the Constitution may require adjustments from time to time. Therefore, they provided two methods for proposing amendments, only one of which has been used in adopting all current amendments. It requires a supermajority of two-thirds of the members of both Houses of Congress to propose an amendment to the states for ratification, and three-fourths of the states to successfully ratify the proposed amendment. In all our history the Constitution has been amended only twenty-seven times&#x2014;the first ten of which, the Bill of Rights, were adopted shortly after the Constitution was ratified. Clearly the Framers did not intend the Constitution to be easily altered. It was to be a lasting contract that could be modified only by the considered judgment of a significant representation of the body politic.<br> <br>But in the 1930s, during the Great Depression, the Statists successfully launched a counterrevolution that radically and fundamentally altered the nature of American society. President Franklin Roosevelt and an overwhelmingly Democratic Congress, through an array of federal projects, entitlements, taxes, and regulations known as the New Deal, breached the Constitution&#x2019;s firewalls. At first the Supreme Court fought back, striking down New Deal programs as exceeding the limits of federal constitutional authority, violating state sovereignty, and trampling on private property rights. But rather than seek an expansion of federal power through the amendment process, which would likely have blunted Roosevelt&#x2019;s ambitions, Roosevelt threatened the very makeup of the Court by proposing to pack it with sympathetic justices who would go along with his counterrevolution. Although Roosevelt&#x2019;s plan failed, the justices had been effectively intimidated. And new justices, who shared Roosevelt&#x2019;s statism, began replacing older justices on the Court. It was not long before the Court became little more than a rubber stamp for Roosevelt&#x2019;s policies.<br> <br>The federal government began passing laws and creating administrative agencies at a dizzying pace, increasing its control over economic activity and, hence, individual liberty. It used taxation not merely to fund constitutionally legitimate governmental activities, but also to redistribute wealth, finance welfare programs, set prices and production limits, create huge public works programs, and establish pension and unemployment programs. Roosevelt used his new power to expand political alliances and create electoral constituencies&#x2014;unions, farmers, senior citizens, and ethnic groups. From this era forward, the Democratic Party and the federal government would become inextricably intertwined, and the Democratic Party would become as dependent on federal power for its sustenance as the governmental dependents it would create. Ironically, industrial expansion resulting from World War II eventually ended the Great Depression, not the New Deal. Indeed, the enormous tax and regulatory burden imposed on the private sector by the New Deal prolonged the economic recovery.<br> <br>The significance of the New Deal is not in any one program, but in its sweeping break from our founding principles and constitutional limitations. Roosevelt himself broke with the two-presidential-term tradition started by George Washington by running for four terms. His legacy includes a federal government that has become a massive, unaccountable conglomerate: It is the nation&#x2019;s largest creditor, debtor, lender, employer, consumer, contractor, grantor, property owner, tenant, insurer, health-care provider, and pension guarantor.<br> <br>And yet, the Statist has an insatiable appetite for control. His sights are set on his next meal even before he has fully digested his last. He is constantly agitating for government action. And in furtherance of that purpose, the Statist speaks in the tongue of the demagogue, concocting one pretext and grievance after another to manipulate public perceptions and build popular momentum for the divestiture of liberty and property from its rightful possessors. The industrious, earnest, and successful are demonized as perpetrators of various offenses against the public good, which justifies governmental intervention on behalf of an endless parade of &#x201c;victims.&#x201d; In this way, the perpetrator and the victim are subordinated to the government&#x2019;s authority&#x2014;the former by outright theft, the latter by a dependent existence. In truth, both are made victims by the real perpetrator, the Statist.<br> <br>The Statist veils his pursuits in moral indignation, intoning in high dudgeon the injustices and inequities of liberty and life itself, for which only he can provide justice and bring a righteous resolution. And when the resolution proves elusive, as it undoubtedly does&#x2014;whether the Marxist promise of &#x201c;the workers&#x2019; paradise&#x201d; or the Great Society&#x2019;s &#x201c;war on poverty&#x201d;&#x2014;the Statist demands ever more authority to wring out the imperfections of mankind&#x2019;s existence. Unconstrained by constitutional prohibitions, what is left to limit the Statist&#x2019;s ambitions but his own moral compass, which has already led him astray? He is never circumspect about his own shortcomings. Failure is not the product of his beliefs but merely want of power and resources. Thus are born endless rationalizations for seizing ever more governmental authority.<br> <br>In the midst stands the individual, who was a predominate focus of the Founders. When living freely and pursuing his own legitimate interests, the individual displays qualities that are antithetical to the Statist&#x2019;s&#x2014;initiative, self-reliance, and independence. As the Statist is building a culture of conformity and dependency, where the ideal citizen takes on dronelike qualities in service to the state, the individual must be drained of uniqueness and self-worth, and deterred from independent thought or behavior. This is achieved through varying methods of economic punishment and political suppression.<br> <br>The Statist also knows that despite his successful usurpations, enough citizens are still skeptical and even distrustful of politicians and government that he cannot force his will all at once. Thus he marches in incremental steps, adjusting his pace as circumstances dictate. Today his pace is more rapid, for resistance has slowed. And at no time does the Statist do an about-face. But not so with some who claim the mantle of conservatism but are, in truth, neo-Statists, who would have the Conservative abandon the high ground of the founding principles for the quicksand of a soft tyranny.<br> <br>Michael Gerson, formerly chief speechwriter for President George W. Bush, has written in his book, Heroic Conservatism, that &#x201c;if Republicans run in future elections with a simplistic anti-government message, ignoring the poor, the addicted and children at risk, they will lose, and they will deserve to lose.&#x201d; Gerson argues for a &#x201c;compassionate conservatism&#x201d; and &#x201c;faith-based initiatives&#x201d; in which the federal government plays a central role.7<br> <br>Gerson all but ignores liberty&#x2019;s successes and the civil society in which humans flourish, even though he is surrounded in his every moment by its magnificence. So numerous are liberty&#x2019;s treasures that they defy cataloguing. The object of Gerson&#x2019;s scorn is misplaced. Gerson does not ask, &#x201c;How many enterprises and jobs might have been created, how many peopl...</p><h2>The Teen&#39;s Guide to Social Media... and Mobile Devices: 21 Tips to Wise Posting in an Insecure World</h2><p><b>Ever regret something you&#x2019;ve posted?</b><br><b>Honestly?

But in a ruthless business, life can be short, and Teresa even has a special cell phone that Guero gave her along with a dark warning. If that phone rings, it means he's dead, and she'd better run, because they're coming for her next.&nbsp;Then the call comes.<br><br>In order to survive, she will have to say goodbye to the old Teresa, an innocent girl who once entrusted her life to a pinche narco smuggler. She will have to find inside herself a woman who is tough enough to inhabit a world as ugly and dangerous as that of the narcos-a woman she never before knew existed. Indeed, the woman who emerges will surprise even those who know her legend, that of the Queen of the South.</p><p><b>Arturo P�rez-Reverte</b>&#x2019;s&nbsp;novels have captivated readers around the world and earned him a reputation as &#x201c;the master of the intellectual thriller&#x201d; (<i>Chicago Tribune</i>).&nbsp;Originally a war correspondent, he now writes fiction full-time. His novels include the Captain Alatriste series,&nbsp;<i>The Flanders Panel, The Club Dumas, The Fencing Master, The Seville Communion, The Nautical Chart,</i>&nbsp;<i>The&nbsp;Queen of the South</i>,&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>What We Become</i>. His books have been published in fifty countries.He is a member of the Spanish Royal Academy. He lives near Madrid, Spain.Teresa Mendoza is the girlfriend of a Mexican drug smuggler who tells her that if the cell phone rings, she must run for her life--he will already be dead. The story of Teresa's life is one of transformation from a young and dependent girlfriend to a tough and untrusting woman who survives pursuit, prison, and even becoming a drug-runner. Perez-Reverte's novel juxtaposes Teresa's story with that of a reporter writing a book about her life a few years later. Lina Patel copes flawlessly with the characters' Mexican Spanish. However, her narration is too subtle to effectively render Teresa's anger and fear. The characters sound so similar to each other that when Perez-Reverte switches from Teresa's story to that of the reporter, the listener can miss the transition.

You can mix and match the fruits depending on what's fresh and available at your local market. Be sure to use equal proportions of all the fruits, cutting or slicing them into similarly shaped pieces, to keep your version true to the original recipe, with no one fruit predominating. If you can't find dragon fruit, try to add at least one dramatic fruit to mix it up a bit, such as carambola, also called star fruit.<br><br>For the competition, the team members used precisely equal amounts of fruit for each serving, but you may prefer to just use an appropriate quantity to avoid waste. If you like, try the recipe using one dragon fruit, a quarter each of the melons and pineapple, and a cupful of each type of berry.<br><br>6 ounces cubed cantaloupe <br>6 ounces cubed honeydew <br>6 ounces cubed pineapple <br>6 ounces cubed watermelon <br>6 ounces sliced dragon fruit <br>6 ounces sliced fresh strawberries <br>6 ounces fresh blackberries <br>6 ounces fresh blueberries <br>6 ounces fresh raspberries <br>4 whole strawberries<br><br>Divide the fruit, except for the whole strawberries, equally among 4 serving bowls. Slice the whole strawberries without cutting through the stem ends, then fan the strawberries on top of the fruit and serve.<br><br>SERVES 4<br><br>Recipe courtesy of THE RED TEAM<br>(Christine Ha, Becky Reams, Felix Fang, Mike Hill, Scott Little, Stacey Amagrande, Tanya Noble)<br><br>SKILL SET/How to Train Your Dragon Fruit<br><br>Dragon fruit is the fruit of a cactus. It has knobby skin that's bright fuchsia or yellow and a seed-speckled interior that's either pink or white, depending on the variety. It has long been popular in Southeast Asia, and now it's becoming increasingly available in American stores. Dragon fruit is also grown in South America and Israel, but wherever your dragon fruit originated and no matter what its color, be sure that the one you're buying is in top condition: firm flesh, evenly colored, and just ripe enough to give very slightly to the pressure of your thumb, like a perfectly ripe avocado. The stem and the little leaves that protrude from the surface should still be soft and flexible, not dry and brittle. A soft fruit with brown spots on the skin is past ripe and should be avoided.<br><br>The flavor is mild and creamy, not at all tart, with a texture sort of like a medium-crisp apple, such as a Golden Delicious. The tiny black seeds have a gentle crunch that's reminiscent of the tiny seeds in a kiwifruit.<br><br>To cut up a dragon fruit, halve the fruit from end to end with a knife, and then use the sharp edge of a teaspoon to scoop the fruit from the tough skin. It will come out of each half in one domed piece that can then be evenly diced.<br><b>OATMEAL WITH BROWN SUGAR AND GOLDEN RAISINS</b><br><br>For a team challenge, the contestants thought they were flying to Hawaii. They were transferred to an airport hotel and woke up to find that instead of boarding a plane to a tropical paradise, they were expected to serve room-service breakfast to an entire hotel! The teams managed admirably to perk up some classics with new twists, but it wasn't exactly a holiday.<br><br>Nevertheless, ordinary oatmeal became a luxurious morning treat, thanks to a simple but novel technique: cooking the oats with golden brown sugar. It adds a caramel-like note to the nutty flavor of the oats and elevates them from everyday cereal. Be sure to use traditional rolled oats here, not quick-cooking oats. Golden raisins and milk stirred in at the end add chewy sweetness and creaminess.<br><br>4 cups water <br>1/4 teaspoon kosher salt <br>2 cups old-fashioned rolled oats <br>1/2 cup packed light brown sugar <br>6 tablespoons golden raisins <br>About 1 cup whole milk <br>Additional light brown sugar<br><br>Combine the water and salt in a medium, heavy-bottomed saucepan, and bring to a boil over high heat. Stir in the oats and the brown sugar and return to a simmer. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer until the oats are tender and the oatmeal is thick, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes. Stir in the raisins and cook until they're plump, about 2 minutes.<br><br>Just before serving, stir enough milk into the oatmeal to thin it to the desired consistency. Divide the oatmeal among 4 bowls. Sprinkle with more brown sugar and serve immediately.<br><br>SERVES 4<br><br>Recipe courtesy of THE RED TEAM<br>(Christine Ha, Becky Reams, Felix Fang, Mike Hill, Scott Little, Stacey Amagrande, Tanya Noble)<br><b>EGGS FOUR WAYS</b><br><br>For a Pressure Test, Monti Carlo found herself required to do nothing more than cook eggs--but to utter perfection. Cooking eggs is simple, right? But doing it without a single flaw is a challenging matter. Monti was really feeling the pressure because she had one shot to get each one right. But she did it, and so can you. For example, if your poached eggs never seem to come out as delicate ovals with tender whites and perfectly runny yolks and without any trailing strands, try Monti's method. It's a winner.<br><br>OMELETS<br><br>2 tablespoons unsalted butter <br>12 large eggs <br>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br><br>Heat an 8- to 10-inch nonstick omelet pan over medium heat until hot.

Pour the beaten egg mixture into the pan. Cook, lifting the edges with a silicone spatula and allowing the uncooked eggs to run onto the pan until the bottom is set and just beginning to brown and the top begins to set, about 3 minutes. Using the spatula, fold over one-third of the omelet (the edge closest to the pan handle) onto the center of the omelet, then tilt the pan and slide the opposite edge of the omelet onto a plate, rolling the center of the omelet onto the unfolded portion to create a trifold.

She's ready to rule the school as a sixth grader, go out for captain of the school basketball team, and take over the bedroom she has always shared with her sister.

She lives with her family in the suburbs of Washington, DC.<b>From <i>The Great Wall of Lucy Wu</i></b><p> <i>At the end of the report folder aisle stood Talent Chang, steering a cart overflowing with school supplies. A huge econo-pack of tape was preparing to fall off the tip of a mountain of colored pencils and manila folders. "Hey, Talent," said Madison cheerily.</i></p><p><i> "Don'tcha think you're getting carried away," I asked. "Even for you?" Madison elbowed me gently.</i></p><p><i> Talent laughed. "I'm not shopping for myself, of course. I completed my shopping as soon as the school list became available." I imagined her breathlessly checking the school website until the supply list was posted. "I'm here with my parents. They're helping start a Chinese school." She looked at me. "It's going to be on Saturday mornings. You should come."</i></p><p><i> Arrgh. That was so Talent. Such a know-it-all. Not would you like to come or maybe you'd be interested. Just assuming she knew everything and what everyone should do.</i></p><p><i> "No thanks," I said, as if I were refusing a piece of gum. "Madison and I have basketball practice on Saturday mornings." This year, if the team made it to regional's, we got to stay overnight in a hotel. I think I would have chosen laundry-folding classes over Chinese school just to get back at Talent.</i></p><p><i> "Lucy," Talent scolded, "Chinese school is much more important than basketball."</i></p><p><i> "Really?" I raised my eyebrows as high as they would go, pretending to be surprised. "Do you need to speak Chinese to play basketball?" If she says that I need help on how to be Chinese, I'm going to wrap those eight rolls of tape around her mouth.</i></p></p><h2>Texas Made/Texas Modern: The House and the Land</h2><p><b>A compelling survey of Texas houses that draw both on the heritage of pioneer ranches and on the twentieth-century design principles of modernism.</b><br><br>Helen Thompson and Casey Dunn, the writer/photographer team that produced the exceptionally successful <i>Marfa Modern</i>, join forces again to investigate Texas modernism. The juxtaposition of the sleek European forms with a gritty Texas spirit generated a unique brand of modernism that is very basic to the culture of the state today. Its roots are in the early Texas pioneer houses, whose long, low profiles express an efficiency that is basic to the modern idiom. This Texas-centric style is focused on the relationship of the house to the site, the materials it is made of--most often local stone and wood--and the way the building functions in the harsh Texas climate.<br><br>Dallas architect David R. Williams was the first to combine modernism with Texas regionalism in the 1930s, and his legacy was sustained by his prot�g� O'Neil Ford, who practiced in San Antonio from the late 1930s until his death in the mid 1970s. Their approach is seen today in the work of Lake/Flato Architects and a new generation of designers who have emerged from that distinguished firm and continue to elegantly merge modernism with the vocabulary of the Texas ranching heritage.<br><br>Twenty houses are included from across the state, with examples in major urban centers like Dallas and Austin and in suburban and rural areas, including a number in the evocative Hill Country.</p><p><b>Helen Thompson</b> is a nationally known writer whose areas of specialty are interior design, architecture, kitchen design, and food. Helen was formerly a food writer and editor for <i>Texas Monthly</i> magazine, where she worked for 17 years. She was also the Texas city editor for <i>Metropolitan Home</i> magazine for 14 years. While at <i>Metropolitan Home</i>, Helen wrote about houses, restaurants, and gardens and produced many of the features shot in Texas during those years. She has also written and produced articles for <i>Elle Decor</i>, <i>Architectural Digest</i>, <i>House Beautiful</i>, <i>Martha Stewart Living</i>, <i>Western Interiors</i>, <i>Traditional Home</i>, <i>Veranda</i>, <i>Country Home</i>, and many other magazines. She is also the author of <i>Marfa Modern, The Big Texas Steakhouse Cookbook</i>, and <i>The Mansion on Turtle Creek Cookbook</i>.<br><br>Casey Dunn is an Austin-based architectural and landscape photographer whose work has appeared in <i>Dwell</i>, the <i>New York Times Magazine</i>, <i>Interior Design</i>, <i>Architectural Digest</i>, <i>Architectural Record</i>, and <i>Paper City Magazine</i>.When you see a modern house, you know it. Brash, lots of glass, radiating the shock of the new even though it&#x2019;s been a century since the movement began, the architectural juggernaut powered through a world impatient to shake off the cultural excesses of the nineteenth century. The new aesthetic rejected the grandiosity of Victorian, Beaux-Arts, and neoclassical architecture, a repudiation that signaled a wondrous leap in the direction of the bold and the new. Modernism exuded authority, and it had an unequivocal look. Le Corbusier, the Swiss-French architect, designer, painter, urban planner, and writer, enumerated five characteristics:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp; Load-bearing columns to replace supporting walls <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp; Open floor plans <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp; Facades unencumbered by structural constraints <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp; Horizontal windows that light rooms equally <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp; Roof gardens<br>Modernism was a perfect fit in Texas, where prosperity boomed and new technology begat structural and manufacturing advancements. But, the use of broad expanses of glass, so alluring as a hallmark of the style, was also its most glaring weakness&#x2014;in Texas, at least. This was clear to two iconoclastic Dallas architects who fervently believed that modernist design in their state should take into account local nuances that the international movement ignored.<br><br>David Williams and O&#x2019;Neil Ford co-opted the modernist movement with their own version of what modern should look like in a state where topography, climate, and culture are powerful. The land and the climate were so compelling, in fact, that it made no sense to these two contrarians to create buildings that did not acknowledge their influence.</p><h2>The Moon Journal: A journey of self-reflection through the astrological year (Astrology Journal, Astrology Gift, Moon Book)</h2><p>The moon, with its illuminating, perpetual cycle that ebbs and flows, is a powerful force that affects all of nature and daily life.

His parents and his only son are long dead, leaving him with neither ancestors nor descendants, tradition nor ties. His job, trafficking the talent of others, has not been his choice. He has passed through life as a spectator, before retreating to the woods of California in the 1970s with only his wife, Ruth, by his side. When an unexpected postcard from a long-lost friend arrives, Allston returns to the journals of a trip he has taken years before, a journey to his mother's birth�place where he once sought a link with his past. Uncovering this history floods Allston with memories, both grotesque and poignant, and finally vindicates him of his past and lays bare that Joe Allston has never been quite spectator enough.</p><p>Wallace Stegner (1909-1993) was the author of, among other novels,&nbsp;<i>Remembering Laughter,</i>&nbsp;1937;&nbsp;<i>The Big Rock Candy Mountain,&nbsp;</i>1943;&nbsp;<i>Joe Hill,</i>&nbsp;1950;&nbsp;<i>All the Little Live Things,</i>&nbsp;1967 (Commonwealth Club Gold Medal);&nbsp;<i>A Shooting Star,</i>&nbsp;1961;&nbsp;<i>Angle of Repose,</i>&nbsp;1971 (Pulitzer Prize);&nbsp;<i>The Spectator Bird,</i>&nbsp;1976 (National Book Award, 1977);&nbsp;<i>Recapitulation,</i>&nbsp;1979; and&nbsp;<i>Crossing to Safety,</i>&nbsp;1987. His nonfiction includes&nbsp;<i>Beyond the Hundredth Meridian,</i>&nbsp;1954;&nbsp;<i>Wolf Willow,</i>&nbsp;1963;&nbsp;<i>The Sound of Mountain Water</i>&nbsp;(essays), 1969;&nbsp;<i>The Uneasy Chair: A Biography of Bernard DeVoto,</i>&nbsp;1974; and&nbsp;<i>Where the Bluebird Sings to the Lemonade Springs: Living and Writing in the West&nbsp;</i>(1992). Three of his short stories have won O. Henry Prizes, and in 1980 he received the Robert Kirsch Award from the Los Angeles Times for his lifetime literary achievements. His&nbsp;<i>Collected Stories</i>&nbsp;was published in 1990.Wallace Stegner isn&#39;t much read any more, and that&#39;s a great shame. Books like THE SPECTATOR BIRD, especially in this fine reading by Edward Herrmann, offer the reward of ideas that will resonate for a long time and characters whose sometimes-epic sorrows resolve on a human scale. Herrmann&#39;s vocal characterizations are subtle but distinct--from the &#34;Bryn Mawr&#34; accent of the narrator&#39;s wife to the accents of the Danish women (including Karen Blixen, better known as Isak Dinesen) whom the narrator meets on a recuperative vacation. As Joseph Alston, a dutiful man whose passions are not easily engaged, Herrmann moves from resignation to frustration to love and self-knowledge. Herrmann gives a mature and complex performance of a mature and complex novel.

Price action analysis is an effective approach to trading today's markets&#x2015;whether you're involved in stocks, futures, or options. It allows you to focus on the process of trading without being overwhelmed by a complicated collection of trading techniques. And while this method may appear elementary, it can significantly enhance returns as well as minimize downside risk. </p><p>One way to apply price action analysis to your trading endeavors is with chart patterns. Nobody understands this better than author Al Brooks, a technical analyst for <i>Futures</i> magazine and an independent trader for more than twenty years. Brooks discovered ten years ago that reading price charts without indicators proved to be the most simple, reliable, and profitable way for him to trade. Mastering that discipline is what made him consistently successful in trading. Now, with <i>Reading Price Charts Bar by Bar</i>, Brooks shares his extensive experience on how to read price action. </p><p>At the end of the day, anyone can look at a chart, whether it is a candle chart for E-mini S&amp;P 500 futures trading or a bar chart for stock trading, and see very clear entry and exit points. But doing this in real time is much more difficult. <i>Reading Price Charts Bar by Bar</i> will help you become proficient in the practice of reading price action&#x2015;through the use of trendlines and trend channel lines, prior highs and lows, breakouts and failed breakouts, and other tools&#x2015;and show you how this approach can improve the overall risk-reward ratio of your trades. </p><p>Written with the serious trader in mind, this reliable resource addresses the essential elements of this discipline, including the importance of understanding every bar on a price chart, why particular patterns are reliable setups for trades, and how to locate entry and exit points as markets are trading in real time. Brooks focuses on five-minute candle charts to illustrate basic principles, but discusses daily and weekly charts as well. Along the way, he also explores intraday swing trades on several stocks and details option purchases based on daily charts&#x2015;revealing how using price action alone can be the basis for this type of trading. </p><p>There's no easy way to trade, but if you learn to read price charts, find reliable patterns, and get a feel for the market and time frame that suits your situation, you can make money. While price action trading doesn't require sophisticated software or an abundance of indicators, this straightforward approach can still put you in a better position to profit in almost any market. <i>Reading Price Charts Bar by Bar</i> will show you how.</p></p><p><p><b>AL BROOKS</b> is a technical analysis contributor to Futures magazine and an independent day trader.

In her latest book, Anne shares her heart and God's teachings on the universal problem of suffering.</p><p>Drawing her characteristically keen insights from the familiar story of Lazarus in the ninth and eleventh chapters of the Gospel of John, Anne offers Jesus' reassuring answers to our heartfelt cries for understanding:</p><ul><li>Why doesn't God care? </li><li>Why does He let these things happen? </li><li>Why me? </li><li>Why doesn't God answer my prayers? </li><li>Why didn't He protect me? </li><li>Why doesn't He perform a miracle?</li></ul><p><em>Why? </em>helps us understand and deal with suffering while guiding us to the ultimate answer-the Savior who shares our grief and our tears.</p></p><p><p>Called "the best preacher in the family" by her late father, Billy Graham, Anne Graham Lotz speaks around the globe with the wisdom and authority of years spent studying God's Word. The <em>New York Times</em> named Anne one of the five most influential evangelists of her generation. Her <em>Just Give Me Jesus</em> revivals have been held in more than 30 cities in 12 different countries to hundreds of thousands of attendees. Anne is a best-selling and award-winning author of 18 books. She is the President of AnGeL Ministries in Raleigh, North Carolina, and she served as Chairman of the National Day of Prayer Task Force from 2016-2017. Whether a delegate to Davos's Economic Forum, a commentator to the <em>Washington Post</em>, or a groundbreaking speaker on platforms throughout the world, Anne's aim is clear--to bring revival to the hearts of God's people. And her message is consistent--calling people into a personal relationship with God through His Word. </p>The veteran preacher and daughter of Billy Graham has a richly deserved reputation as a charismatic interpreter of God's word. In this tenacious audio, she recounts a series of tragedies with compassion and worldly authority, all the while referring to her Bible like someone who knows the truths in her heart, rather than just on the sacred pages. Her reading is clear and compelling, though slightly confined by the recording studio, in contrast to how one imagines she would sound in front of a crowd. Moving us beyond the question of why God allows suffering, she takes listeners to a higher realm where she lifts up the defeated and inspires a sense of community in those who feel abandoned.

He played Carlo Rizzi, the husband of Connie Corleone, who set up her brother Sonny, played by James Caan, for a hit. Russo didn't have to act - he knew the Mob inside and out, from his childhood in Little Italy, to Mafia legend Frank Costello who took him under his wing, to acting as a messenger to New Orleans Mob boss Carlos Marcello during the Kennedy assassination, to having to go on the lam after shooting and killing a member of the Colombian drug cartel in his Vegas club (he was acquitted of murder when the court ruled this as justifiable homicide). <br><br>Along the way, Russo befriended Frank Sinatra, who became his son's godfather, and Marlon Brando, who mentored his career as an actor after trying to get Francis Ford Coppola to fire him from <i>The Godfather</i>. Russo had passionate affairs with Marilyn Monroe, Liza Minelli and scores of other celebrities. He went on to star in <i>The Godfather: Parts I</i> and <i>II</i>, <i>Seabiscuit</i>, <i>Any Given Sunday</i> and <i>Rush Hour 2</i>, among many other films in which he also acted as producer. <i>Hollywood Godfather</i> is his no-holds-barred account of a life lived on the edge.

As hunters, they would have been constantly scanning their environment, looking for food or threats (distractibility); they&#x2019;d have to act without hesitation (impulsivity); and they&#x2019;d have to love the high-stimulation and risk-filled environment of the hunting field. With our structured public schools, office workplaces, and factories those who inherit a surplus of &#x201c;hunter skills&#x201d; are often left frustrated in a world that doesn&#x2019;t understand or support them. <br><br>As Hartmann shows, by reframing our view of ADHD, we can begin to see it not as a disorder, but as simply a difference and, in some ways, an advantage. He reveals how some of the world&#x2019;s most successful people can be labeled as ADHD hunters and offers concrete non-drug methods and practices to help hunters--and their parents, teachers, and managers--embrace their differences, nurture creativity, and find success in school, at work, and at home. Providing a supportive &#x201c;survival&#x201d; guide to help fine tune your natural skill set, rather than suppress it, Hartmann shows that each mind--whether hunter, farmer, or somewhere in between--has value and great potential waiting to be tapped.</p><p>Thom Hartmann is the host of the nationally and internationally syndicated talkshow <i>The Thom Hartmann Program</i> and the TV show <i>The Big Picture</i> on the Free Speech TV network. He is the award-winning New York Times bestselling author of 24 books, including <i>Attention Deficit Disorder: A Different Perception, ADHD</i> and the <i>Edison Gene</i>, and <i>The Last Hours of Ancient Sunlight, </i>which inspired Leonardo DiCaprio&#x2019;s film <i>The 11th Hour</i>. A former psychotherapist and founder of the Hunter School, a residential and day school for children with ADHD, he lives in Washington, D.C.<b>Chapter 3. Hunters in Our Schools and Offices</b> <br><br>Prior to the early 1970s, when ADHD was first characterized as a specific disorder, ADHD children and adults were largely treated simply as &#x201c;bad people&#x201d;. They were the kids who always got into trouble, the James Deans of the world, the rootless and unsettled adults like Abraham Lincoln&#x2019;s father, The Lone Ranger, or John Dillinger. <br><br>More recent research, however, has demonstrated a high incidence of ADHD among the parents of ADHD children. This discovery caused some psychologists to initially postulate that ADHD was the result of growing up in a dysfunctional family; they suggested that ADHD may follow the same pattern as child or spousal abuse. The dietary-cause advocates contended that children pattern their parent&#x2019;s eating habits, and this accounts for the generational patterns of ADHD. Other studies suggest that, like Down&#x2019;s Syndrome or muscular dystrophy, ADHD is a genetic disease, with the A1 variant of the D2 dopamine receptor gene identified by scientists as the leading candidate. <br><br>But if ADHD is a genetic disease or an abnormality, it&#x2019;s a popular one, possibly afflicting as many as 25 million individuals in the United States. With such a wide distribution among our population, is it reasonable to assume that ADHD is simply a quirk? That it&#x2019;s some sort of an aberration caused by defective genes or child abuse? Where did ADHD come from? The answer is: people with ADHD are the leftover hunters, those whose ancestors evolved and matured thousands of years in the past in hunting societies. <br><br>As the human race moved from its earliest ancestors, two basic types of cultures evolved. In the areas that were lush with plant and animal life and had a low human population density, hunters and gatherers predominated. In other parts of the world (particularly Asia), farming or agricultural societies evolved. <br><br><b><i>Successful Hunters</i></b> <br><br>Be it pursuing buffalo in North America, hunting deer in Europe, chasing wildebeest in Africa, or picking fish from a stream in Asia, these hunters needed a certain set of physical and mental characteristics to be successful:<br><br><b> � They constantly monitor their environment.</b> Failure to be fully aware of the environment and notice the faint sound might mean a swift and painful death or the difference between a full belly and hunger. <br><br><b>� They can totally throw themselves into the hunt; time is elastic.</b> Another characteristic of a good Hunter is the ability to totally focus on the moment, abandoning all consideration of any other time or place. When the Hunter sees the prey he gives chase simply living totally in that one pure moment. When involved in the hunt, time seems to speed; when not in the hunt, time becomes slow. While a Hunter&#x2019;s ability to concentrate in general may be low, his ability to utterly throw himself into the hunt at the moment is astonishing. <br><br><b>� They&#x2019;re flexible, capable of changing strategy on a moment&#x2019;s notice.</b> If the wild boar vanishes into the brush, and a rabbit appears, the Hunter is off in a new direction. Orderliness is not particularly important to a Hunter, but the abilities to make a quick decision and then act on it are vital. <br><br><b>� They can throw an incredible burst of energy into the hunt,</b> so much so that they often injure themselves or exceed &#x201c;normal&#x201d; capabilities, without realizing it until later. Not unlike that quintessential of all Hunters, the lion, they have incredible bursts of energy--but not necessarily a lot of staying power. <br><br><b>� They think visually.</b> Hunters often describe their actions in terms of pictures, rather than words or feelings. They create outlines in their heads of where they&#x2019;ve been and where they&#x2019;re going. Hunters often aren&#x2019;t much interested in abstractions. <br><br><b>� They love the hunt, but are easily bored by mundane tasks,</b> such as having to clean the fish, dress the meat, or fill out the paperwork. Kemmons Wilson, the founder of Holiday Inns, had a group of executives he called Bear Skinners who would take care of the details of &#x201c;skinning and cleaning&#x201d; after Wilson had &#x201c;shot the bear&#x201d; (negotiated a new hotel site, brought in new financing, opened a new division, etc.). <br><br><b>� They&#x2019;ll face danger that &#x201c;normal&#x201d; individuals would avoid.</b> A wounded boar, or elephant, or bear, can kill you--and many a Hunter has been killed by his would-be prey. If you extend this analogy to warfare, where the Hunters are often the front line infantry or the most aggressive officers, the same is true. Hunters take risks. <br><br><b>� They&#x2019;re hard on themselves and those around them.</b> When your life depends on split-second decisions, your frustration and impatience threshold necessarily tend to be low. A fellow Hunter who doesn&#x2019;t get out of the way of a shot, or a soldier who defies orders and smokes on a dark night showing the enemy your position, cannot be tolerated.<br><br><b><i>People with ADHD Are Descendants of Hunters</i></b> <br><br>If you compare the list of classic ADHD symptoms, and the list of the characteristics of a good hunter, you&#x2019;ll see that they match almost perfectly. In other words, an individual with the ADHD collection of characteristics would make an extraordinarily good hunter. A failure to have any one of those characteristics might mean death in the forest or jungle. <br><br>It is my hope that this book will help us remove the stigma of &#x201c;illness&#x201d; or &#x201c;deficit&#x201d; associated with a diagnosis of ADHD and related conditions. A second, and equally important, goal is to provide specific tools to &#x201c;work around&#x201d; the dilemma of being an ADHD &#x201c;Hunter&#x201d; in a contemporary society that is largely structured for and by non-ADHD &#x201c;Farmers,&#x201d; a concept we will explore in detail. The individuals with whom I&#x2019;ve shared this theory have found it both positive and transformational. This is the spirit in which this book is offered, with the sincere hope that it may help more teachers, psychologists, psychiatrists, and parents to empower and enable rather than label as sick or disabled ADD children and adults.</p><h2>The Wild Book</h2><p>Fefa struggles with words. She has word blindness, or dyslexia, and the doctor says she will never read or write. Every time she tries, the letters jumble and spill off the page, leaping away like bullfrogs. How will she ever understand them? <p>But her mother has an idea. She gives Fefa a blank book filled with clean white pages. "Think of it as a garden," she says. Soon Fefa starts to sprinkle words across the pages of her wild book. She lets her words sprout like seedlings, shaky at first, then growing stronger and surer with each new day. And when her family is threatened, it is what Fefa has learned from her wild book that saves them. </p></p><p><p><b>Margarita Engle</b> is a Cuban-American poet and&nbsp;novelist whose work has been published in many countries.

A meticulously researched work, <i>Mayflower 1620</i> offers children a compelling, fresh account of this much-told story. <br><br>Vibrant photography of a rare reenactment using the <i>Mayflower II</i> leads readers imaginatively into the narrative. The vivid and informative text explores the story behind the exhibits at the living-history museum in Plymouth, Massachusetts. Primary sources record what the voyagers wore, what they ate, and telling details of their journey. First-person accounts reveal the hopes and dreams they carried. Readers share in the long hours at sea, and in the dangers faced after landfall. Extensive end notes, a map, a detailed chronology, and a bibliography round out the full story of the <i>Mayflower</i>. <br><br>Readers experience a new look at this seminal historical event through the eyes of those who now regularly inhabit the world of the pilgrims&#x2014;the actors who interpret the Pilgrim Voyage. This eye-opening book teaches children the value of closely reexamining everything we think we know.</p><p>Kindergarten-Grade 4-This account of the voyage of the Mayflower is illustrated with photographs taken on a June, 2001, cruise of the Mayflower II. The illustrations are the real draw here-large, vivid, and expertly composed. The historical context of the original voyage is briefly sketched, as is the journey itself. Short chapters chronicle the provisioning of a ship from that time and describe navigation techniques. The readable text gives a good idea of the many unpleasant aspects of shipboard life in 1620, but doesn't present information that isn't available in many other books. The authors state that the settlers had "little or no respect" for Native Americans. Regarding the seed corn and other items that the exploratory parties took from the Native villages, the comment is that "few- considered this stealing." No mention is made of William Bradford's journal note that the goods would be paid for when the owners could be identified, and that this was done the following spring. Susan Whitehurst's lavishly illustrated The Mayflower (PowerKids, 2003) is briefer. Kate Waters's On the Mayflower: Voyage of the Ship's Apprentice and a Passenger Girl (Scholastic, 1996) is also illustrated with color photographs of interpreters aboard the Mayflower II, but fictionalizes events. Ann McGovern's -If You Sailed on the Mayflower in 1620 (Scholastic, 1991) looks drab by comparison, but contains more information. Children will enjoy looking at this book, and it is a reasonable choice to supplement classroom units.<br><i>Elaine Fort Weischedel, Millbury Public Library, MA</i><br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.Gr. 5-9. Like Grace O'Neill's <i>1621: A New Look at Thanksgiving</i> (2001), from the same publisher, this handsome, large-size photo-essay draws on exhibits in the living history museum Plimoth Plantation to re-create a historical event and to distinguish fact from legend. This time the picturesque color photos are of actors in authentic costume on a recent re-creation of the <i>Mayflower</i>'s famous voyage from England and the founding of Plimoth Colony. There is lots of fascinating detail in text, the captions, and the lengthy endnotes about voyagers (including a young boy); why they left; how they navigated; and what they found when they made landfall. Many legends are shown to be false: the settlers didn't call themselves Pilgrims; they didn't all leave for religious reasons; and, above all, they didn't find an empty paradise for the taking. The actors are clearly having fun, and readers, who will be intrigued by the pageantry, may want to talk about the history and what it means to us today. A map, a detailed chronology, and a bibliography are included. <i>Hazel Rochman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Starting with the magical, mythical explanations for the wonders of nature, Dawkins reveals the exhilarating scientific truths behind these occurrences. This is a page-turning detective story that not only mines all the sciences for its clues but primes the reader to think like a scientist as well.</p><p><b>Richard Dawkins</b> is a Fellow of the Royal Society and was the inaugural holder of the Charles Simonyi Chair of Public Understanding of Science at Oxford University.

That sounds straightforward, doesn&#x2019;t it? Actually, it isn&#x2019;t. There are various problems. What about dinosaurs, which once existed but exist no longer? What about stars, which are so far away that, by the time their light reaches us and we can see them, they may have fizzled out?<br> <br>We&#x2019;ll come to dinosaurs and stars in a moment. But in any case, how do we know things exist, even in the present? Well, our five senses &#x2013; sight, smell, touch, hearing and taste &#x2013; do a pretty good job of convincing us that many things are real: rocks and camels, newly mown grass and freshly ground coffee, sandpaper and velvet, waterfalls and doorbells, sugar and salt. But are we only going to call something &#x2018;real&#x2019; if we can detect it directly with one of our five senses?<br> <br>What about a distant galaxy, too far away to be seen with the naked eye? What about a bacterium, too small to be seen without a powerful microscope? Must we say that these do not exist because we can&#x2019;t see them? No. Obviously we can enhance our senses through the use of special instruments: telescopes for the galaxy, microscopes for bacteria. Because we understand telescopes and microscopes, and how they work, we can use them to extend the reach of our senses &#x2013; in this case, the sense of sight &#x2013; and what they enable us to see convinces us that galaxies and bacteria exist.<br> <br>How about radio waves? Do they exist? Our eyes can&#x2019;t detect them, nor can our ears, but again special instruments &#x2013; television sets, for example &#x2013; convert them into signals that we can see and hear. So, although we can&#x2019;t see or hear radio waves, we know they are a part of reality. As with telescopes and microscopes, we understand how radios and televisions work. So they help our senses to build a picture of what exists: the real world &#x2013; reality. Radio telescopes (and X-ray telescopes) show us stars and galaxies through what seem like different eyes: another way to expand our view of reality.<br> <br>Back to those dinosaurs. How do we know that they once roamed the Earth? We have never seen them or heard them or had to run away from them. Alas, we don&#x2019;t have a time machine to show them to us directly. But here we have a different kind of aid to our senses: we have fossils, and we can see <i>them</i> with the naked eye. Fossils don&#x2019;t run and jump but, because we understand how fossils are formed, they can tell us something of what happened millions of years ago. We understand how water, with minerals dissolved in it, seeps into corpses buried in layers of mud and rock. We understand how the minerals crystallize out of the water and replace the materials of the corpse, atom by atom, leaving some trace of the original animal&#x2019;s form imprinted on the stone. So, although we can&#x2019;t see dinosaurs directly with our senses, we can work out that they must have existed, using indirect evidence that still ultimately reaches us through our senses: we see and touch the stony traces of ancient life.<br> <br>In a different sense, a telescope can work like a kind of time machine. What we see when we look at anything is actually light, and light takes time to travel. Even when you look at a friend&#x2019;s face you are seeing them in the past, because the light from their face takes a tiny fraction of a second to travel to your eye. Sound travels much more slowly, which is why you see a firework burst in the sky noticeably earlier than you hear the bang. When you watch a man chopping down a tree in the distance, there is an odd delay in the sound of his axe hitting the tree.<br> <br>Light travels so fast that we normally assume anything we see happens at the instant we see it. But stars are another matter. Even the sun is eight light-minutes away. If the sun blew up, this catastrophic event wouldn&#x2019;t become a part of our reality until eight minutes later. And that would be the end of us! As for the next nearest star, Proxima Centauri, if you look at it in 2012, what you are seeing is happening in 2008. Galaxies are huge collections of stars. We are in one galaxy called the Milky Way. When you look at the Milky Way&#x2019;s next-door neighbour, the Andromeda galaxy, your telescope is a time machine taking you back two and a half million years. There&#x2019;s a cluster of five galaxies called Stephan&#x2019;s Quintet, which we see through the Hubble telescope spectacularly colliding with each other. But we see them colliding 280 million years ago. If there are aliens in one of those colliding galaxies with a telescope powerful enough to see us, what they are seeing on Earth, at this very moment, here and now, is the early ancestors of the dinosaurs.<br> <br>Are there really aliens in outer space? We&#x2019;ve never seen or heard them. Are they a part of reality? Nobody knows; but we do know what kind of things could one day tell us if they are. If ever we got near to an alien, our sense organs could tell us about it. Perhaps somebody will one day invent a telescope powerful enough to detect life on other planets from here. Or perhaps our radio telescopes will pick up messages that could only have come from an alien intelligence. For reality doesn&#x2019;t just consist of the things we already know about: it also includes things that exist but that we don&#x2019;t know about yet and won&#x2019;t know about until some future time, perhaps when we have built better instruments to assist our five senses.<br> <br>Atoms have always existed, but it was only rather recently that we became sure of their existence, and it is likely that our descendants will know about many more things that, for now, we do not. That is the wonder and the joy of science: it goes on and on uncovering new things. This doesn&#x2019;t mean we should believe just <i>anything</i> that anybody might dream up: there are a million things we can imagine but which are highly unlikely to be real &#x2013; fairies and hobgoblins, leprechauns and hippogriffs. We should always be open-minded, but the only good reason to believe that something exists is if there is real evidence that it does.<br> <br><b>Models: testing our imagination</b><br> <br>There is a less familiar way in which a scientist can work out what is real when our five senses cannot detect it directly. This is through the use of a &#x2018;model&#x2019; of what <i>might</i> be going on, which can then be tested. We imagine &#x2013; you might say we guess &#x2013; what might be there. That is called the model. We then work out (often by doing a mathematical calculation) what we ought to see, or hear, etc. (often with the help of measuring instruments) if the model were true. We then check whether that is what we actually do see. The model might literally be a replica made out of wood or plastic, or it might be a piece of mathematics on paper, or it might be a <i>simulation</i> in a computer. We look carefully at the model and <i>predict</i> what we ought to see or hear, etc. if the model were correct. Then we look to see whether the predictions are right or wrong. If they are right, this increases our confidence that the model really does represent reality; we then go on to devise further experiments, perhaps refining the model, to test the findings further and confirm them. If our predictions are wrong, we reject the model, or modify it and try again.<br> <br>Here&#x2019;s an example. Nowadays, we know that genes &#x2013; the units of heredity &#x2013; are made of stuff called DNA. We know a great deal about DNA and how it works. But you can&#x2019;t see the details of what DNA looks like, even with a powerful microscope. Almost everything we know about DNA comes indirectly from dreaming up models and then testing them.<br> <br>Actually, long before anyone had even heard of DNA, scientists already knew lots about genes from testing the predictions of models. Back in the nineteenth century, an Austrian monk called Gregor Mendel did experiments in his monastery garden, breeding peas in large quantities. He counted the numbers of plants that had flowers of various colours, or that had peas that were wrinkly or smooth, as the generations went by. Mendel never saw or touched a gene. All he saw were peas and flowers, and he could use his eyes to <i>count</i> different types. He invented a <i>model</i>, which involved what we would now call genes (though Mendel didn&#x2019;t call them that), and he calculated that, if his model were correct, in a particular breeding experiment there ought to be three times as many smooth peas as wrinkly ones. And that is what he found when he counted them. Leaving aside the details, the point is that Mendel&#x2019;s &#x2018;genes&#x2019; were an invention of his imagination: he couldn&#x2019;t see them with his eyes, not even with a microscope. But he could see smooth and wrinkled peas, and by counting them he found indirect evidence that his <i>model</i> of heredity was a good representation of something in the real world. Later scientists used a modification of Mendel&#x2019;s method, working with other living things such as fruit flies instead of peas, to show that genes are strung out in a definite order, along threads called chromosomes (we humans have forty-six chromosomes, fruit flies have eight). It was even possible to work out, by testing models, the exact order in which genes were arranged along chromosomes. All this was done long before we knew that genes were made of DNA.<br> <br>Nowadays we know this, and we know exactly how DNA works, thanks to James Watson and Francis Crick, plus a lot of other scientists who came after them. Watson and Crick could not see DNA with their own eyes. Once again, they made their discoveries by imagining models and testing them. In their case, they literally built metal and cardboard models of what DNA might look like, and they calculated what certain measurements ought to be if those models were correct. The predictions of one model, the so-called double helix model, exactly fitted the measurements made by Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins, using special instruments involving X-rays beamed into crystals of purified DNA. Watson and Crick also immediately realized that their model of the structure of DNA would produce exactly the kind of results seen by Gregor Mendel in his monastery garden.<br> <br>We come to know what is real, then, in one of three ways. We can detect it directly, using our five senses; or indirectly, using our senses aided by special instruments such as telescopes and microscopes; or even more indirectly, by creating models of what <i>might</i> be real and then testing those models to see whether they successfully predict things that we can see (or hear, etc.), with or without the aid of instruments. Ultimately, it always comes back to our senses, one way or another.<br> <br>Does this mean that reality only contains things that can be detected, directly or indirectly, by our senses and by the methods of science? What about things like jealousy and joy, happiness and love? Are these not also real?<br> <br>Yes, they are real. But they depend for their existence on brains: human brains, certainly, and probably the brains of other advanced animal species, such as chimpanzees, dogs and whales, too. Rocks don&#x2019;t feel joy or jealousy, and mountains do not love. These emotions are intensely real to those who experience them, but they didn&#x2019;t exist before brains did. It is possible that emotions like these &#x2013; and perhaps other emotions that we can&#x2019;t begin to dream of &#x2013; could exist on other planets, but only if those planets also contain brains &#x2013; or something equivalent to brains: for who knows what weird thinking organs or feeling machines may lurk elsewhere in the universe?<br> <br><b>Science and the supernatural: explanation and its enemy</b><br> <br>So that is reality, and that is how we can know whether something is real or not. Each chapter of this book is going to be about one particular aspect of reality &#x2013; the sun, for instance, or earthquakes, or rainbows, or the many different kinds of animals. I want now to turn to the other key word of my title: magic. Magic is a slippery word: it is commonly used in three different ways, and the first thing I must do is distinguish between them. I&#x2019;ll call the first one &#x2018;supernatural magic&#x2019;, the second one &#x2018;stage magic&#x2019; and the third one (which is my favourite meaning, and the one I intend in my title) &#x2018;poetic magic&#x2019;.<br> <br>Supernatural magic is the kind of magic we find in myths and fairy tales. (In &#x2018;miracles&#x2019;, too, though I shall leave those to one side for now and return to them in the final chapter.) It&#x2019;s the magic of Aladdin&#x2019;s lamp, of wizards&#x2019; spells, of the Brothers Grimm, of Hans Christian Andersen and of J. K. Rowling. It&#x2019;s the fictional magic of a witch casting a spell and turning a prince into a frog, or a fairy godmother changing a pumpkin into a gleaming coach. These are the stories we all remember with fondness from our childhood, and many of us still enjoy when served up in a traditional Christmas pantomime &#x2013; but we all know this kind of magic is just fiction and does not happen in reality.<br> <br>Stage magic, by contrast, really does happen, and it can be great fun. Or at least, <i>something</i> really happens, though it isn&#x2019;t what the audience thinks it is. A man on a stage (it usually is a man, for some reason) deceives us into thinking that something astonishing has happened (it may even <i>seem</i> supernatural) when what really happened was something quite different. Silk handkerchiefs cannot turn into rabbits, any more than frogs can turn into princes. What we have seen on the stage is only a trick. Our eyes have deceived us &#x2013; or rather, the conjuror has gone to great pains to deceive our eyes, perhaps by cleverly using words to distract us from what he is really doing with his hands.<br> <br>Some conjurors are honest and go out of their way to make sure their audiences know that they have simply performed a trick. I am thinking of people like James &#x2018;The Amazing&#x2019; Randi, or Penn and Teller, or Derren Brown. Even though these admirable performers don&#x2019;t usually tell the audience exactly <i>how</i> they did the trick &#x2013; they could be thrown out of the Magic Circle (the conjurors&#x2019; club) if they did that &#x2013; they do make sure the audience knows that there was no supernatural magic involved. Others don&#x2019;t actively spell out that it was just a trick, but they don&#x2019;t make exaggerated claims about what they have done either &#x2013; they just leave the audience with the rather enjoyable sensation that something mysterious has happened, without actively lying about it. But unfortunately there are some conjurors who are deliberately dishonest, and who pretend they really do have &#x2018;supernatural&#x2019; or &#x2018;paranormal&#x2019; powers: perhaps they claim that they really can bend metal or stop clocks by the power of thought alone. Some of these dishonest fakes (&#x2018;charlatans&#x2019; is a good word for them) earn large fees from mining or oil companies by claiming that they can tell, using &#x2018;psychic powers&#x2019;, where would be a good place to drill. Other charlatans exploit people who are grieving, by claiming to be able to make contact with the dead. When this happens it is no longer just fun or entertainment, but preying on people&#x2019;s gullibility and distress. To be fair, it may be that not all of these people are charlatans. Some of them may sincerely believe they are talking to the dead.<br> <br>The third meaning of magic is the one I mean in my title: poetic magic. We are moved to tears by a beautiful piece of music and we describe the performance as &#x2018;magical&#x2019;. We gaze up at the stars on a dark night with no moon and no city lights and, breathless with joy, we say the sight is &#x2018;pure magic&#x2019;. We might use the same word to describe a gorgeous sunset, or an alpine landscape, or a rainbow against a dark sky. In this sense, &#x2018;magical&#x2019; simply means deeply moving, exhilarating: something that gives us goose bumps, something that makes us feel more fully alive. What I hope to show you in this book is that reality &#x2013; the facts of the real wo...</p><h2>Southern Sweden and Norway Map (National Geographic Adventure Map, 3301)</h2><p><b>� Waterproof � Tear-Resistant � Travel Map</b><p></p><p>National Geographic's Southern Sweden and Norway Adventure Map provides global travelers with the perfect combination of detail and perspective in a highly functional travel tool.

But only one of them was there to commit murder.<br><br>It was the third week in August, the height of the summer. The schools were closed, and whole families had taken advantage of the fine weather to arrive at the old air base, less than a mile from the sea. They had strolled around vintage planes from the first and second world wars: single-seat biplanes parked next to Spitfires and Hurricanes. That morning, the Red Arrows had put on a dazzling display, twisting and crisscrossing each other in the sky before swooping down, trailing plumes of red, white, and blue. There had been fly-pasts by the Tornado GR4, the two-seat attack aircraft that had been used in Iraq and Libya, and by the Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter, one of the most sophisticated and&#x2014;at $125 million&#x2014;one of the most expensive aircrafts in the world. The grounds were packed with simulator rides, motorbike displays, drones, face-painting and fairground stalls. Everyone was having a good time.<br><br>As with every public event in the UK, an extensive, almost invisible security net had been put in place. It was impossible to stop and search all the cars, but CCTV cameras recorded every arrival and every license plate was instantly checked. People might notice police and even a few sniffer dogs moving among them. These were a common sight. But they would have been unaware of the plainclothes policemen, many of them with concealed weapons, mingling with the crowd. In fact the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre (JTAC) had met in their offices close to the Houses of Parliament just a few days before and had agreed that the threat level at the Suffolk Air Show would remain at moderate. They weren&#x2019;t expecting any trouble.<br><br>And so nobody had paid very much attention to the woman who had arrived just after three o&#x2019;clock. She had driven into the parking lot in a Ford Transit van that, according to the Automatic Number Plate Recognition system, belonged to the St John Ambulance service. This was the country&#x2019;s leading first aid charity, and indeed, the woman was dressed in the green and black uniform of a local volunteer. She was carrying a nylon bag marked with a white cross that, if opened, would reveal medicine and bandages.<br><br>She was short and round-shouldered with dark red hair that had been cut very badly so that it stuck out straight on one side of her skull and curled on the other. There was something quite aggressive about the way she walked, like a boxer about to enter the ring. She was overweight, breathing heavily with beads of sweat on her upper lip. As she walked, she slipped on a pair of cheap sunglasses. They concealed the smoldering violence in her eyes.<br><br>There was a separate entrance leading into the air base, reserved for paramedics, technicians, organizers&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. anyone working the event. She stopped and showed a pass that identified her as Jane Smith, but this was not her real name, nor had she ever worked for the St John Ambulance service. The security man at the gate might have wondered why she had arrived so late in the day, when the event was almost over. He might have asked her why she was alone. But he was tired and he was looking forward to getting home. He glanced at her pass and waved her through. He didn&#x2019;t even look inside the bag.<br><br>The woman&#x2019;s real name was Dragana Novak. She was forty-six years old, and until recently she had been a lieutenant colonel in the Serbian air force; a highflier in every sense of the word. Her career had ended following a drunken fight with another pilot. He had been twice her size, but even so, she had put him into the hospital. In fact he was still there. Inevitably, there had been a court-martial, and she had been looking forward to an uncertain future&#x2014;perhaps even a return to the turnip farm where she had been brought up. That was when she had received the telephone call. There was a unique job opportunity. It would pay two hundred thousand dollars a day for two days&#x2019; work. Was she interested?<br><br>Dragana didn&#x2019;t need to think for a minute. She had met her contact in a local tavern in Belgrade, where she had tucked into her favorite dish of sarma&#x2014;spicy beef wrapped in cabbage leaves&#x2014;washed down with a large glass of rakija&#x2014;the local plum brandy. The man, who had never given her his name, had told her what was needed. It was a tricky operation that would demand all her skills. Dragana hadn&#x2019;t asked any questions. All she cared about was the money. It was more than she had been paid in her life.<br><br>She was still dreaming about jewelry, fast cars, and expensive chocolates as she made her way past the various exhibition stands, the bars, the fast-food outlets. People were already drifting toward the seats for the last flying display of the afternoon. For many of them it was the high point of the entire show. The aircraft was sitting out on the tarmac, patiently waiting for the pilot to walk over and take the controls. Dragana stopped at the barrier that ran the full length of the runway and took out a pair of binoculars. Without removing her dark glasses, she raised them to her eyes. Slowly, unable to help herself, she smiled.<br><br>This was what she had come to steal.<br><br>The American-built Sikorsky CH-53E is also known as the Super Stallion, and there&#x2019;s really no helicopter in the world that&#x2019;s quite like it. Looking at it, it&#x2019;s hard to believe that it can fly at all. For a start, it&#x2019;s huge: as tall as a three-story building and longer than three London buses parked end to end. It&#x2019;s also surprisingly ugly, bolted together as if the designers had never actually had any plans.<br><br>The Super Stallion can fly&#x2014;at two hundred miles per hour&#x2014;and what makes it special is that it can carry an enormous load. It is the workhorse for the United States military, capable of lifting sixteen tons of cargo. When the Americans mount an assault, it can transport a platoon with enough weapons to obliterate an entire army. How does it even get off the ground? Part of the answer is that it has no fewer than three hugely powerful turboshaft engines. It also has enormous titanium-fiberglass rotor blades, seventy-nine feet in diameter. Most helicopters have just four blades. The Super Stallion has seven.<br><br>Dragana Novak examined the Super Stallion, running her eyes over the gray-painted fuselage, the cockpit, the tail rotor. The Serbian air force couldn&#x2019;t possibly afford a machine like this, but Dragana had briefly flown one when she was on a training exercise with the United Nations and still remembered the thrill it had given her. In less than thirty minutes&#x2019; time, it would be hers. She had no children. She had never married. But right now, looking at the helicopter, she felt its power reaching out to her and knew that she was completely in love.<br><br>It was time to move. Everything had been planned down to the last second, and she had been shown exactly where she had to go. There were several hangars on the other side of the runway, but two buildings dominated the airfield closer by, both of them left over from the last war. One was the control tower. The other was a low redbrick building with about twenty evenly spaced windows and several doors. This had been an office complex, but it was being used to house the pilots and technicians during the show with changing rooms, rest areas, and a cafeteria at the far end.<br><br>Hoisting her medicine bag over her shoulder, Dragana strolled toward the entrance where two more uniformed officials were standing behind a conveyor belt that fed into an X-ray machine, exactly the same sort of device that could be found at any airport. First, visitors would have their cases and shopping bags scanned. Then there was a metal detector that everyone had to pass through.<br><br>&#x201c;Hello,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m here to see Sergeant Perkins.&#x201d; She had spent five years studying in London before qualifying as a pilot and spoke good English but with a heavy accent that made her seem as if she disliked everything she was saying.<br><br>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d; The officials glanced at one another, puzzled. They had been here all day, and this was the first time they had seen her.<br><br>Dragana smiled, showing gray teeth, discolored by wine and cigarettes. Her right hand slipped into the pocket of her jacket. &#x201c;He has a headache. I have some aspirin for him.&#x201d;<br><br>Of course the story was ridiculous. The two men should have rung the control tower to get confirmation. But just like the guard at the main gate, they came to all the wrong conclusions. This was a single woman. She was wearing a St John Ambulance uniform. It was the end of the day, almost the end of the entire event. What possible harm could there be? &#x201c;All right,&#x201d; one of them said. &#x201c;Your bag has to go through the machine, and remove any metal objects from your pockets.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Of course.&#x201d; Dragana placed the medicine bag on the belt and watched as it was carried slowly into the machine. She knew that there was nothing inside to cause any alarm. Next, she stepped through the metal detector and smiled to herself as the light flashed green. She collected her things and continued on her way. This was going to be even easier than she had thought.<br><br>She continued down a long corridor with a wooden floor and old-fashioned hanging lights. A few people passed her but didn&#x2019;t give her a second glance. Again, the uniform saw to that. She came to a door at the end and knocked politely.<br><br>&#x201c;Come in!&#x201d; Even in just two words, she could detect the American accent.<br><br>There were two men sitting in the room, both wearing flight suits. First Sergeant Brad Perkins was in his early thirties but looked much younger: clean-shaven, fair-haired, with blue eyes. He had recently graduated as a pilot from the US Army Aviation Center at Fort Rucker in Alabama, and this was one of his first deployments. He was a little annoyed to find himself not just in England but in some place he&#x2019;d never heard of. Suffolk? Where the heck was that? There was a copilot sitting with him, also American, about the same age, drinking Coke. Dragana didn&#x2019;t know his name. Nor did she care.<br><br>&#x201c;How can we help you?&#x201d; Perkins asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Well, actually, you can die.&#x201d; Dragana had taken an unusual-looking gun out of her jacket pocket. It was white and made of ceramic, which was why it had passed unnoticed through the metal detector. She squeezed the trigger twice. The gun used a small chamber of compressed air to fire not bullets but plastic needles, each one tipped with tetrodotoxin, one of the deadliest poisons on the planet. Tetrodotoxin, or TTX as it&#x2019;s known, is a neurotoxin found in certain fish and octopuses and is extremely fast-acting. Brad struggled to his feet but died before he was halfway there. His partner tried to say something, stared, then collapsed.<br><br>Dragana put the gun away and went over to the two men. Sergeant Brad Perkins stared up at her with empty eyes. He was the smaller of the two, about her size. She reached down and unbuttoned his uniform.<br><br>Ten minutes later, she walked out of the building, now dressed in a flight suit and carrying a leather folder. Nobody stopped her as she reached the Super Stallion and climbed inside. The ground staff had been expecting two men, not a single woman. And she was twenty minutes early. But still nobody challenged her. After all, she looked as if she knew what she was doing. She was dressed for the part. And the very idea that somebody might be about to steal a gigantic helicopter in broad daylight was so bizarre, so outrageous, that nobody even considered it.<br><br>And so she was completely relaxed as she slipped on a set of headphones and strapped herself in. Out of habit, she ran her eye over the various gauges, checking the fuel levels. She flicked on the master battery, the avionics, and the fuel valve master, then watched as the seven huge blades began to turn, picking up speed until they were no more than a blur. Even with the headphones, she was deafened by the engines. She rested her left hand on the collective control, then leaned over and adjusted the throttle. She could feel the downdraft underneath her, beating onto the tarmac at ninety miles per hour.<br><br><i>Stallion One. You are clear for takeoff&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</i><br><br>The voice came from the control tower, a young man, very English, stupidly cheerful.<br><br>A final check. She had reached proper operating RPM (revs per minute). Using the throttle and the foot pedals, she steered the Super Stallion along the runway, gently guiding it. This was the moment she loved, when this huge machine belonged only to her. She found herself whispering to it in her own language, urging it to obey her commands as it tilted forward then rose, impossibly, into the air.<br><br>As they left the ground, she thought briefly of the two men she had killed. She had no pity for them. After all, she was a military officer who had been trained to kill people&#x2014;although she had been disappointed that she had never had the opportunity until today. Ten minutes in the air and two hundred thousand dollars in the bank. She would have killed fifty more people for that. She reached out and pressed on the cyclic lever, bringing the nose of the helicopter down and urging it forward. Obeying her commands, the Super Stallion shot out beyond the coastline and over the sea.<br><br><i>Stallion One. Turn left heading zero five zero and ascend flight level one hundred, over.</i><br><br>The man in the control tower was still jabbering in her ear. Of course she wasn&#x2019;t going to do what he said. In fact, he was beginning to annoy her. She reached down and turned the volume off. Then she turned right.<br><br>They would know almost at once that something was wrong. The path of the helicopter would be traced by primary and secondary radar systems. Very soon, there would be a red alert at the National Air Traffic Service center at Swanwick. It might have happened already. They would know that she had strayed from the agreed flight path and was not responding to their commands. They would already be tracking her. There were dozens of satellites in outer space, and they would be directed to watch her every move. And of course, the Super Stallion was filled with communications equipment that she had been unable to neutralize and that would be transmitting even now. She loved the helicopter. It belonged to her. But she couldn&#x2019;t stop it from giving the two of them away.<br><br>Timing was everything. She had memorized the exact route she had to take and made the necessary adjustments. The gray surface of the North Sea was beneath her, but now she brought the helicopter around, traveling south. Looking out of the window, she saw the port of Felixstowe, the lines of cranes and gantries lined up along the docks, the two rivers&#x2014;the Stour and the Orwell&#x2014;stretching inland. She checked her course and accelerated, sweeping low over the pier and the seafront. She knew she would be seen, but that didn&#x2019;t matter. In a way, it would help.<br><br>The field she was looking for was just south of the A12, the road that led from Suffolk to London. There was a scattering of buildings, an abandoned farm. She had already been shown the maps and photographs and had studied them so many times that she recognized them instantly. She noticed a few cars parked around the ...</p><h2>The Meaning of the Holy Qu&#39;ran (English, Arabic and Arabic Edition)</h2><p>This is a new 11th edition of the best-seller translation of the Meaning of The Holy Qur&#39;an by Abdullah Yusuf Ali, published by Amana Publications.</p><p>PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION by &#x2018;Abdullah Yusuf &#x2018;Ali <p>I do not wish to write a long Preface. I wish merely to explain the history of my Project, the scope and plan of this work, and the objects I have held in view. </p><p>In separate introductory Notes I have mentioned the useful books to which I have referred, under the headings: Commentaries on the Qur'an; Translations of the Qur'an; and Useful Works of Reference. I have similarly explained the system, which I have followed in the Transliteration of Arabic Words and Names; the Abbreviations I have used; and the Principal Divisions of the Qur'an. </p><p>It may be asked: Is there any need for a fresh English Translation? To those who ask this question I commend a careful consideration of the facts, which I have set out in my note on Translations of the Qur'an. After they have read it, I would invite them to take any particular passage say 2:74, or 2:102, or 2:164 and compare it with any previous version they choose. If they find that I have helped them even the least bit further in understanding its meaning, or appreciating its beauty, or catching something of the grandeur of the original, I would claim that my humble attempt is justified. </p><p>It is the duty of every Muslim-man, woman, or child-to read the Qur'an and understand it according to his own capacity. If anyone of us attains to some knowledge or understanding of it by study, contemplation, and the test of life, both outward and inward, it is his duty, according to his capacity, to instruct others, and share with them the joy and peace which result from contact with the spiritual world. The Qur'an-indeed every religious book-has to be read, not only with the tongue and voice and eyes, but with the best light that our intellect can supply, and even more, with the truest and purest light which our heart and conscience can give us. It is in this spirit that I would have my readers approach the Qur'an. </p><p>It was between the ages of four and five that I first learned to read its Arabic words, to revel in its rhythm and music, and wonder at its meaning. I have a dim recollection of the khatm ceremony which closed that stage. It was called "completion": it really just began a spiritual awakening that has gone on ever since. My revered father taught me Arabic, but I must have imbibed from him into my innermost being something more, something which told me that all the world's thoughts, all the world's most beautiful languages and literatures, are but vehicles for that ineffable message which comes to the heart in rare moments of ecstasy. The soul of mysticism and ecstasy is in the Qur'an, as well as the plain guidance for the plain man, which a world in a hurry affects to consider as sufficient. It is good to make this personal confession, to an age in which it is in the highest degree unfashionable to speak of religion or spiritual peace or consolation, an age in which words like these draw forth only derision, pity, or contempt. </p><p>I have explored Western lands, Western manners, and the depths of Western thought and Western learning, to an extent, which has rarely fallen to the lot of an Eastern mortal. But I have never lost touch with my Eastern heritage. Through all my successes and failures, I have learned to rely more and more upon the one true thing in all life-the voice that speaks in a tongue above that of mortal man. For me the embodiment of that voice has been in the noble words of the Arabic Qur'an, which I have tried to translate for myself and apply to my experience repeatedly. The service of the Qur'an has been the pride and the privilege of many Muslims. I felt that with such life-experience as has fallen to my lot, my service to the Qur'an should be to present it in a fitting garb in English. That ambition I have cherished in my mind for more than forty years. I have collected books and materials for it. I have visited places, undertaken journeys, taken notes, sought the society of men, and tried to explore their thoughts and hearts, in order to equip myself for the task. Sometimes I have considered it too stupendous for me-the double task of understanding the original, and reproducing its nobility, its beauty, its poetry, its grandeur, and its sweet practical reasonable application to everyday experience. Then I have blamed myself for lack of courage-the spiritual courage of men who dared all in the Cause, which was so dear to them. </p><p>Two sets of apparently accidental circumstances at last decided me. A man's life is subject to inner storms far more devastating than those in the physical world around him. In such a storm, in the bitter anguish of a personal sorrow which nearly unseated my reason and made life seem meaningless, a new hope was born out of a systematic pursuit of my long-cherished project. Watered by tears, my manuscript began to grow in depth and earnestness if not in bulk. I guarded it like a secret treasure. Wanderer that l am, I carried it about, thousands of miles, to all sorts of countries and among all sorts of people. At length, in the city of Lahore, I happened to mention the matter to some young people who held me in respect and affection. They showed an enthusiasm and an eagerness which surprised me. They almost took the matter out of my hands. They asked for immediate publication. I had various bits ready, but not even one complete Siparah (Juz&#x2019; (1/30 of the Qur&#x2019;an) )*. They made me promise to complete at least one Siparah* before I left Lahore. As if by magic, a publisher, a katib (calligraphist to write the Arabic Text), an engraver of blocks for such text, a printer were found, all equally anxious to push forward the scheme. Blessed be youth, for its energy and determination. "Where others flinch, rash youth will dare!"</p>Gentle and discerning reader! what I wish to present to you is an English Interpretation, side by side with the Arabic Text. The English shall be, not a mere substitution of one word for another, but the best expression I can give to the fullest meaning which I can understand from the Arabic Text. The rhythm, music, and exalted tone of the original should be reflected in the English Interpretation. It may be but a faint reflection, but such beauty and power as my pen can command shall be brought to its service. I want to make English itself an Islamic language, if such a person as I can do it. And I must give you all the accessory aid which I can. In rhythmic prose, or free verse (whichever you like to call it), I prepare the atmosphere for you in a running Commentary. Introducing the subject generally, I come to the actual Surahs. Where they are short, I give you one or two paragraphs of my rhythmic Commentary to prepare you for the Text. Where the Surah is long, ! <p>I introduce the subject matter in short appropriate paragraphs of the Commentary from time to time, each indicating the particular verses to which it refers. The paragraphs of the running Commentary are numbered consecutively, with some regard to the connection with the preceding and the following paragraphs. It is possible to read this running rhythmic Commentary by itself to get a general bird's-eye view of the contents of the Holy Book before you proceed to the study of the Book itself. </p><p>It is important that at least in lslamic countries one system of numbering should be adopted. I have adopted mainly that of the Egyptian edition published under the authority of the King of Egypt. This will probably be accepted in Egypt and in Arabic-speaking countries, as those countries generally look up to Egypt in matters of literature. I am glad to see that the text shortly to be published by the Anjumani Himayati Islam of Lahore is following the same system of numbering. I recommend to other publishers in India the same good example. If once this is done we shall have a uniform system of numbering. I have retained the numbering of Sections, as it is universally used in the Arabic copies, and marks a logical division of the Surahs. I have supplied a further aid to the reader in indicating subdivision of the Sections into paragraphs. They are not numbered, but are distinguished by the use of a flowery initial letter. </p><p>In translating the Text I have aired no views of my own, but followed the received Commentators. Where they differ among themselves, I have had to choose what appeared to me to be the most reasonable opinion from all points of view. Where it is a question merely of words, I have not considered the question important enough to discuss in the Notes, but where it is a question of substance, I hope adequate explanations will be found in the Notes. Where I have departed from the literal translation in order to express the spirit of the original better in English, I have explained the literal meaning in the Notes. For example, see 2:104 n. and 2:26 n. In choosing an English word for an Arabic word, a translator necessarily exercises his own judgment and may be unconsciously expressing a point of view, but that is inevitable. </p><p>Let me explain the scope of the Notes. I have made them as short as possible consistently with the object I have in view, viz., to give to the English reader, scholar as well as general reader, a fairly complete but concise view of what I understand to be the meaning of the Text. To discuss theological controversies or enter into polemical arguments I have considered outside my scope. Such discussions and arguments may be necessary and valuable, but they should find a place in separate treatises, if only out of respect to the Holy Book. Besides, such discussions leave no room for more important matters on which present-day readers desire information. In this respect, our Commentators have not always been discreet. On questions of law, the Qur'an lays down general principles, and these I have explained. I have avoided technical details: these will be found discussed in their proper place in my book on "Anglo-Muhammadan Law". Nor have I devoted much space to grammatical or philological Notes. On these points, I consider that the labors of the vast body of our learned men in the past have left little new to say now. There is usually not much controversy, and I have accepted their conclusions without setting out the reasons for them. Where it has been necessary for the understanding of the Text to refer to the particular occasion for the revelation of a particular verse, I have done so briefly, but have not allowed it to absorb a disproportionate amount of space. It will be found that every verse revealed for a particular occasion has also a general meaning. The particular occasion and the particular people concerned have passed away, but the general meaning and its application remain true for all time. What we are concerned about now, in the fourteenth century of the Hijrah, is: what guidance can we draw for ourselves from the message of Allah? </p><p>I spoke of the general meaning of the verses. Every earnest and reverent student of the Qur'an, as he proceeds with his study, will find, with an inward joy difficult to describe, how this general meaning also enlarges as his own capacity for understanding increases. It is like a traveler climbing a mountain: the higher he goes, the farther he sees. From a literary point of view, the poet Keats has described his feeling when he discovered Chapman's Homer: </p><p>Then felt I like some watcher of the skies <br>When anew planet swims into his ken, <br>Or like stout Cortez when with eagle eyes <br>He stared at the Pacific-and all his men <br>Looked at each other with a wild surmise <br>Silent, upon a peak in Darien. </p><p>How much greater is the joy and sense of wonder and miracle when the Qur'an opens our spiritual eyes! The meaning which we thought we had grasped expands. New worlds are opened out. As we progress, still newer, and again newer worlds "swim into our ken". The miracle deepens and deepens, and almost completely absorbs us. And yet we know that the "face of Allah "our final goal-has not yet been reached. We are in the mulk of Sulayman (2:102), which the evil ones denied, belied, and even turned into blasphemy. But we can ignore blasphemy, ridicule and contempt, for we are on the threshold of Realities, and a little perfume from the garden of the Holy One has already gladdened our nostrils. </p><p>Such meaning it is most difficult to express. But where I can, I have indicated it in the Notes, in the Commentary, and with the help of the rhythm and the elevated language of the Text. </p><p>One final word to my readers. Read, study, and digest the Holy Book. Read slowly, and let it sink into your heart and soul. Such study will, like virtue, be its own reward. If you find anything in this volume to criticize, please let it not spoil your enjoyment of the rest. If you write to me, quoting chapter and verse, I shall be glad to consider your criticism, but let it not vex you if I exercise my own judgment in deciding for myself. Any corrections accepted will be gratefully acknowledged. On the other hand, if there is something that specially pleases you or helps you, please do not hesitate to write to me. I have given you other interests to help you. It will be a pleasure to know that my labor has not been in vain. If you address me in care of my Publisher at his Lahore address, he will always forward the letters to me. </p><p>A.

The book offers insight from fellow members of, in the haunting words of one dad, &#x201c;this terrible, terrible club,&#x201d; which consists of men who have experienced the death of a child. This book is a collection of survival stories by men who have survived the worst possible loss and lived to tell the tale. They are real stories that pull no punches and are told with brutal honesty. Men that have shared their deepest and darkest moments. Moments that included thoughts of suicide, self-medication and homelessness. Some of these men have found their way back from the brink while others are still standing there, stuck in their pain. The core message of Grieving Dads is &#x201c;you&#x2019;re not alone.&#x201d; It is a message that desperately needs to be delivered to grieving dads who often grieve in silence due to society&#x2019;s expectations. Grieving Dads: To the Brink and Back is a book that no grieving dad or anyone who cares for him should be without. As any grieving parent will tell you, there are no words to describe the hell one experiences after the death of a child. Many men have no clue how to deal with or understand the myriad emotional, mental, and physical responses experienced after the death of a child. Stories appearing in the book have been carefully selected to represent a cross-section of fathers, as well as a diverse portrayal of loss. This approach helps reflect the full spectrum of grief, from the early days of shock and trauma to the long view after living with loss for many years. Any bereaved father will find brotherhood in these pages, and will feel that someone understands them. While there is plenty of raw emotion in this book&#x2014;the stories are not exercises in self-pity nor are they studies in grief. They are survival stories instead. Some are testimonies to hope. Some are gut-wrenching accounts of overwhelming despair. But all of them are real-life stories from real-life grieving dads, and they show that even if one reaches his physical and emotional bottom, it is possible (although not easy) to live through that pain and find one&#x2019;s way to the other side of grief. Most dads in this book found themselves in a state of physical, mental, and emotional collapse after the death of their child. As if the losses alone weren&#x2019;t enough to drive these men to the brink, most try to deal with their grief according to the conventional wisdom so many men are brought up with, which perversely, increases their suffering all the more. We all know the party line about how men are &#x201c;supposed&#x201d; to deal with loss or even disappointment: toughen up, get back to work, take it like a man, support your wife, don&#x2019;t talk about your emotions, don&#x2019;t lose control, and if you must cry&#x2014;by all means do so in private.</p><p>As you can imagine, this book wasn't easy to write.&nbsp; However, the message of how men grieve needs&nbsp;to be heard.&nbsp; I spent over two years speaking with 1000's of grieving dads to determine if what I was feeling as a grieving dad was a "normal" reaction to a not so normal situation.&nbsp; I've heard some of the most heartbreaking stories one can possibly hear.&nbsp; Navigating through the aftermath of losing a child is ruthless and often seems like its not survivable, but it is.&nbsp; If you&nbsp;or someone you know have lost a child, I encourage you to read the reviews this book has been given by others&nbsp;that&nbsp;have walked in your shoes.&nbsp; It's a tough read, but there is a lot of truth in this book.Kelly Farley, like many men, was caught up in the rat race of life when he experienced the loss of two children over an 18-month period. He lost his daughter, Katie, in 2004, and son, Noah, in 2006. During the losses and the years that followed, he felt like he was the only dad that had ever experienced such a loss. He realized that society, for the most part, doesn&#x2019;t feel comfortable with an openly grieving man. That realization inspired him to write his book Grieving Dads: To the Brink and Back. In addition to this book, Kelly maintains a blog at www.GrievingDads.com and is currently pursuing his M.S. Ed. degree in counseling to continue his mission of helping others through profound life experiences. Kelly has a passion for helping people &#x201c;pick up the pieces&#x201d; after a profound life event. He also works as a personal recovery coach to help people put their life back together. Kelly lives in the suburbs of Chicago but still dreams of escaping the rat race.

She took her police badge out of her pocket, along with her flashlight and an extra clip for her Glock, and tossed them all onto the dresser. The time on her phone showed it was almost midnight. Lena had rolled out of bed eighteen hours ago and now all she wanted to do was fall back in. Not that she&#x2019;d done that much lately. For the past four days, just about every waking hour had been wasted sitting at a conference room table answering questions she&#x2019;d answered the day before and the day before that&#x2014;�navigating the usual bullshit that came from having to justify your actions to Internal Affairs.<br><br>&#x201c;Who led the raid into the house?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What intelligence were you acting on?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What did you expect to find?&#x201d;<br><br>The internal investigator for the Macon Police Department had the dour, lifeless personality of a career pencil pusher. Every day, the woman showed up dressed in the same style black skirt and white blouse, an outfit that seemed more appropriate for greeting diners at an Olive Garden. She nodded a lot, frowned even more as she took notes. When Lena didn&#x2019;t answer quickly, she&#x2019;d check the tape recorder to make sure it was picking up the silences.<br><br>Lena was certain the questions were designed to provoke an outburst. The first day, she had been so numb that she&#x2019;d just answered truthfully in the hope that it would soon be over. The second and third days, she&#x2019;d been less forthcoming, her level of irritation rising with each passing minute. Today, she had finally exploded, which seemed exactly what the woman had been waiting for.<br><br>&#x201c;What do you think I expected to find, you miserable bitch?&#x201d;<br><br>If only Lena hadn&#x2019;t found it. If only she could take a razor and slice the images out of her brain. They haunted her. They flickered into her vision like an old movie every time she blinked. They filled her with a constant, unrelenting sorrow.<br><br>Lena started to rub her eyes, then thought better of it. Six days had passed since she&#x2019;d led her team on the raid, but her body was still a walking reminder of what had happened. The bruise fingering its way across her nose and underneath her left eye had turned a urine-�yellow. The three stitches holding together the cut in her scalp itched like a rash.<br><br>Then there were the things that no one could see&#x2014;�Lena&#x2019;s bruised tailbone. Her aching back and knees. The roil in her stomach every time she thought about what she&#x2019;d discovered in that desolate house in the woods.<br><br>Four dead bodies. One man still in the hospital. Another who would never wear the badge again. Not to mention the terrible memory she would probably end up taking to her grave.<br><br>Tears came into Lena&#x2019;s eyes. She bit her lip, fighting the urge to let the grief have its way. She was exhausted. The week had been hard. Hell, the last three weeks had been hard. But it was over now. All of it was over. Lena was safe. She would keep her job. The rat squad investigator had scurried back to her hole. Lena was finally home where no one could stare at her, question her, probe and prod her. It wasn&#x2019;t just Internal Affairs. Everyone wanted to know what the raid had been like, what Lena had found in that dark, dank basement.<br><br>And Lena wanted nothing more than to forget all about it.<br><br>Her cell phone chirped. Lena exhaled until her lungs were completely empty. The phone chirped a second time. She picked it up. There was a new text message.<br><br>VICKERY: u ok?<br><br>Lena stared at the letters on the screen. Paul Vickery, her partner.<br><br>She tapped reply. Her thumb hovered over the keyboard.<br><br>The distant rumble of a motorcycle shook the air.<br><br>Instead of typing out a response, Lena held down the power button until the phone turned off. She placed it on the dresser beside her badge.<br><br>The roar of the Harley-�D&#x2019;s twin-�cam engine vibrated in her ears as Jared gunned the bike so he could make it to the top of their steep driveway. Lena waited, following the familiar sounds: the engine cutting, the metallic groan of the kickstand, the heavy tread of boots as her husband made his way into the house, tossed his helmet and keys onto the kitchen table even though she&#x2019;d asked him a million times not to. He paused for a moment, probably to check the mail, then continued toward their bedroom.<br><br>Lena kept her back to the door as she counted off Jared&#x2019;s footsteps down the long hallway. His stride sounded tentative, reluctant. He&#x2019;d probably been hoping Lena would be asleep.<br><br>Jared stopped at the doorway. He was obviously waiting for Lena to turn around. When she didn&#x2019;t, he asked, &#x201c;You just get in?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I stayed late to finish.&#x201d; It wasn&#x2019;t a complete lie. She&#x2019;d hoped Jared would be asleep, too. &#x201c;I was about to take a shower.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;All right.&#x201d;<br><br>Lena didn&#x2019;t go into the bathroom. Instead, she turned to face him.<br><br>Jared&#x2019;s gaze flickered down to her bra, then quickly back up again. He was dressed in his uniform, his hair twisted into a peak from the helmet. He was a cop with the Macon PD, too&#x2014;�a motorman, one rank below Lena and twelve years younger. Neither one of these things used to bother her, but lately, every inch of their lives was a provocation.<br><br>He leaned against the doorjamb, asking, &#x201c;How&#x2019;d it go?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;They cleared me to go back to work.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s good, right?&#x201d;<br><br>She replayed his words in her head, trying to decipher the tone. &#x201c;Why wouldn&#x2019;t it be?&#x201d;<br><br>Jared didn&#x2019;t respond. There was a long, uncomfortable silence before he asked, &#x201c;You want a drink?&#x201d;<br><br>Lena couldn&#x2019;t hide her surprise.<br><br>&#x201c;I guess it&#x2019;s okay now, right?&#x201d; He tilted his head to the side, forced his lips into a tight smile. He was a few inches taller than Lena, but his muscular frame and athletic grace made him seem larger.<br><br>Usually.<br><br>Jared cleared his throat to let her know that he was waiting.<br><br>She nodded. &#x201c; &#x2019;Kay.&#x201d;<br><br>Jared left the room, but his need lingered&#x2014;�surrounding her, almost suffocating her. He needed for Lena to break down. He needed for her to lean on him. He needed her to show him that what happened had affected her, had altered her in some tangible way.<br><br>He couldn&#x2019;t see that not giving in was the only thing that kept her from falling completely apart.<br><br>Lena took her pajamas out of the dresser. She heard Jared moving around the kitchen. He opened the freezer door, rummaged around for a handful of ice. Lena closed her eyes. Her body swayed. She waited for the cubes to hit glass. Her mouth watered in anticipation.<br><br>She clenched her jaw. Forced open her eyes.<br><br>She wanted the drink too badly. When Jared came back, she would put the glass down, wait a few minutes, prove to herself that she could do without it.<br><br>Prove to him that she didn&#x2019;t need it.<br><br>Her hands ached as she unbuttoned her jeans. The day of the raid, she&#x2019;d gripped her shotgun so hard that her fingers had felt like they were permanently curled. She wasn&#x2019;t sure why everything still ached. She should be better now, but her body was holding on to the hurt. Holding on to the poison that was eating her up inside.<br><br>&#x201c;So.&#x201d; Jared was back. This time, he came into the room. He poured a large vodka as he walked toward her, the bottle gurgling as the liquid splashed into the glass. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re back on duty tomorrow?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;First thing.&#x201d;<br><br>He handed her the glass. &#x201c;No time off?&#x201d;<br><br>Lena took the drink and downed half of it in one gulp.<br><br>&#x201c;I guess that&#x2019;s the same as when . . .&#x201d; Jared&#x2019;s voice trailed off. He didn&#x2019;t have to say when. Instead, he looked out the back window. The dark panes showed his reflection. &#x201c;I bet you get your sergeant&#x2019;s stripes off this.&#x201d;<br><br>She shook her head, but said, &#x201c;Maybe.&#x201d;<br><br>He stared at her&#x2014;�waiting. Needing.<br><br>She asked, &#x201c;What are they saying at the station?&#x201d;<br><br>Jared walked to the closet. &#x201c;That you&#x2019;ve got balls of steel.&#x201d; He dialed the combination on the gun safe. Lena watched the back of his neck. There was a pink line of sunburn where his helmet didn&#x2019;t protect the skin. He must&#x2019;ve known she was watching, but he just took his holster off his belt and stored his gun beside hers. Near hers. He didn&#x2019;t even let their guns touch.<br><br>She asked, &#x201c;Does it bother you?&#x201d;<br><br>He shut the safe door, spun the combination. &#x201c;Why would it bother me?&#x201d;<br><br>Lena didn&#x2019;t say the words, but they were screaming in her head: Because they think I&#x2019;m tougher than you. Because your wife was taking down some very bad guys while you were toodling around on your bike giving tickets to soccer moms.<br><br>Jared said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m proud of you.&#x201d; He used his reasonable voice, the one that made Lena want to punch him in the face. &#x201c;They should give you a medal for what you did.&#x201d;<br><br>He had no idea what she&#x2019;d done. Jared only knew the highlights, the details Lena was allowed to share outside closed doors.<br><br>She repeated the question. &#x201c;Does it bother you?&#x201d;<br><br>He paused for a second too long. &#x201c;It bothers me that you could&#x2019;ve been killed.&#x201d;<br><br>He still hadn&#x2019;t answered the question. Lena studied his face. The skin was unlined, fresh. She&#x2019;d met Jared when he was twenty-�one, and in the five and a half years since, he&#x2019;d somehow started looking younger, like he was aging in reverse. Or maybe Lena was getting older more quickly. So much had changed since those early days. In the beginning, she could always tell what he was thinking. Of course, since then, she&#x2019;d given him plenty of mortar to build up a wall around himself.<br><br>He started unbuttoning his shirt. &#x201c;I think I&#x2019;m gonna go put those cabinets together.&#x201d;<br><br>She gave a startled laugh. &#x201c;Really?&#x201d; The kitchen had been torn apart for three months, mostly because Jared found a new reason every weekend to not work on it.<br><br>He let his shirt drop to the floor. &#x201c;At least Ikea will know I&#x2019;m still the man of the house.&#x201d;<br><br>Now that it was out there, Lena didn&#x2019;t know how to respond. &#x201c;You know it&#x2019;s not like that.&#x201d; Even to her own ears, the excuse sounded weak. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s just not.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Really?&#x201d;<br><br>Lena didn&#x2019;t answer.<br><br>&#x201c;Right.&#x201d; Jared&#x2019;s cell phone started to ring. He pulled it out of his pocket, checked the number, and declined the call.<br><br>&#x201c;That your girlfriend?&#x201d; Lena didn&#x2019;t like the thinness in her tone. The joke wasn&#x2019;t funny. They both knew that.<br><br>He rummaged through the dirty-�clothes basket and found his jeans, one of his T-�shirts.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s almost midnight.&#x201d; Lena looked at the bedside clock. &#x201c;Past midnight.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sleepy.&#x201d; He dressed quickly, tucking his phone into his back pocket. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll keep the noise down.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You need your phone to put the cabinets together?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The charge is low.&#x201d;</p><h2>Lost Books of the Bible: The Great Rejected Texts</h2><p>The Lost Books of the Bible: The Great Rejected Texts - Eighteen of the most sought after books available, which shed light on the evolution of our faith, our theology, and our church.

He believed in giving cultivated American life its fitting architectural equivalent and applied his idealism to structures across the continent, from suburban homes to churches, offices, skyscrapers, and the celebrated Guggenheim Museum.</p><p>Wright&#x2019;s work is distinguished by its harmony with humanity and its environment, a philosophy he called organic architecture, and which found its paradigm at Fallingwater, a house in rural Pennsylvania, cited by the American Institute of Architects as &#x201c;the best all-time work of American architecture.&#x201d; Wright also made a particular mark with his use of industrial materials, and by the simple L or T plan of his Prairie House which became a model for rural architecture across America. Wright was also often involved in many of the interior elements of his buildings, such as the furniture and stained glass, paying particular attention to the balance between individual needs and community activity.</p><p>Exploring Wright&#x2019;s aspirations to augment American society through architecture, this book offers a concise introduction to his at once technological and Romantic response to the practical challenges of middle-class Americans.</p></p><p>Bruce Brooks Pfeiffer became Frank Lloyd Wright&#x2019;s apprentice at the Taliesin Fellowship in 1949. In 1957, he attended the Ecole Nationale des Beaux-Arts in Paris, returning in 1958 to continue his apprenticeship with Wright until his death in 1959. He remains at Taliesin to this day, as director of the Frank Lloyd Wright Archives, a vice-president of the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation, and author of numerous publications on Wright's life and work.<br><br>Peter G�ssel runs an agency for museum and exhibition design.

When I was a baby, my mom had a friend who left the LDS church because she practiced plural marriage. When my mom learned about this, it piqued her interest, and she began studying the principle as well. Soon after, she suggested to my dad that the family move to Utah. He didn&#x2019;t know her religious reasons at the time, but he said sure, let&#x2019;s move&#x2014;though it took them four and a half more years of research and studying the principle before they actually did. We finally moved to Utah when I was five years old.<br> <br>It was my mother who urged my father to take his first plural wife. He did, and she joined the family when I was only five, but I still have fond memories of her. Unfortunately, it was a short marriage with no children, and she left two years later. When I was ten, my mom and dad once again brought a new wife into the family. I didn&#x2019;t think there was anything strange about it&#x2014;in fact, I was excited. I was a shy kid and didn&#x2019;t make friends easily. When I found out that the woman my father was courting was from a large polygamous family, I was thrilled to have the chance to get to know a whole new group of people and be able to make more friends. Our family grew quickly. Eventually, my father took four wives in addition to my mother. In total, I have twenty-seven siblings!<br> <br>I was in a slightly easier position than many of my siblings who came from my father&#x2019;s second, third, fourth, or fifth marriages. Since I was the child of my father&#x2019;s first marriage, his &#x201c;legal&#x201d; one, it was simple and natural for my father to be my father in public. Since polygamy isn&#x2019;t widely accepted, for the other kids, it could be more difficult to acknowledge their father publicly. To my father&#x2019;s credit, he &#x201c;owned,&#x201d; that is, acted as a true father to, every one of my brothers and sisters.<br> <br>Growing up, I always assumed I would live the polygamous lifestyle. It was the tradition in which I was raised. My biological parents and my mother&#x2019;s sister wives all seemed happy for the most part. Of course there were the normal ups and downs that happen in any family. I loved being part of a large family; it felt normal and comfortable. My parents, however, never pushed me toward the principle. They wanted me to make my own decisions and come to plural marriage, if I chose, through my own route.<br> <br>My parents&#x2019; only rule about religion was that I had to go to church, but this isn&#x2019;t so different from millions of parents around the world. It was always made clear to me that whatever religion I embraced as an adult&#x2014;whether our branch of fundamentalism, LDS, or something else&#x2014;was entirely up to me.<br> <br>Despite the fact that I was shy, I managed to make a number of friends outside our church group. I worked at a portrait studio and became friendly with many of my coworkers, which helped me to overcome my shyness. Perhaps because I interacted with so many people outside my faith when I was a teenager, for a time I really questioned whether or not I was going to live the principle of plural marriage. I was struggling to find my way and discover my own identity within our close-knit community and the requirements of our faith&#x2014;and then I met Kody.<br> <br>&nbsp;<br> Kody<p></p> <br>I was raised in the LDS faith. Both of my parents were devout Mormons. However, when I was fourteen years old, my mother pulled me aside and explained to me some of the doctrines of Mormonism that are a little more intense. One of these is that of celestial plural marriage. The moment my mother described the principle to me, I had a feeling that this was something I was going to follow. I had no idea how or when, I just knew.<br> <br>Of course, being young and stubborn, I battled hard against this calling. In the LDS church there&#x2019;s absolutely no opportunity to explore plural marriage. It&#x2019;s simply not done. Plural marriage is one of the few things that sets the Mormon fundamentalist faith apart from followers of the LDS church. The religions are similar, but this one difference is astronomical. Embracing it meant leaving the faith of my childhood forever.<br> <br>When I was nineteen, I was sent on my LDS mission to southern Texas. During the two years I spent proselytizing for the Mormon church, the doctrine of plural marriage was constantly on my mind. It spoke to me. It called to me. But I still had no idea what to do with this summons.<br> <br>While I was away in the ministry in Texas, I got a letter from my mother telling me that my parents had been excommunicated from the LDS church and had joined a fundamentalist Mormon faith. I thought, Well, this is interesting. But I was still too hardheaded to see it as a sign that I should follow in their footsteps. My parents&#x2019; excommunication from the Mormon church broke my heart. I was deeply concerned about their spiritual welfare, but God spoke peace to me. I continued my service in the mission field and finished my two-year calling.<br> <br>By the time I returned from my mission, my father had taken a second wife. My mother had written me dozens of letters about how wonderful her sister wife was, so although I had never met my new mom, I was ready to accept her completely. She deserved my respect and my love, simply because my father had married her.<br> <br>When I returned to Utah from Texas, I immediately experienced the remarkable warmth of the principle of plural marriage as my mother had explained it to me years before. The warmth and love I imagined would go hand in hand with a polygamous lifestyle were no longer an unattainable ideal. They were real and concrete and precisely as I had imagined they would be. My mother was away, but here was another woman who loved my father and whom my father loved, and by extension, we grew to love each other as mother and son. It was an easy and wonderful evolution.<br> <br>Even though my parents had converted to fundamentalism and I&#x2019;d discovered for myself the warmth of the polygamous lifestyle, I was still uncertain about converting myself. I began associating with members of my parents&#x2019; new church and attending their gatherings. I thought I knew what I wanted, but it took me a while to make a commitment. Then I met a girl named Meri, and that changed everything.<br> <br>&nbsp;<br> Meri<p></p> <br>I first noticed Kody at church. Our church group is quite close-knit and has been together a long time, so any new face really stands out. He caught my eye, and I believe I caught his. Someone introduced us, but beyond a brief hello, I don&#x2019;t think we said a word to each other. I was eighteen, and I&#x2019;d never been courted by a guy before. Shoot, I was so quiet that I&#x2019;d probably never even been noticed by a guy before! So nothing of a romantic nature crossed my mind during that first meeting.<br> <br>That summer I attended a camp for girls of our faith. One of my fellow campers, a girl named Christy, was here from out of state and had a photo of her brother who was attending our church in Utah. When she showed it to me, I immediately recognized Kody.<br> <br>A few months after camp ended, Christy came back to Utah from her home in Wyoming to attend a wedding. She invited me over to the house where she was staying. I walked in the door and there was Kody, sitting on the couch! He said, &#x201c;Hi, Meri! You&#x2019;re the Meri my sister is always talking about.&#x201d;<br> <br>I was shocked that he knew my name. I was used to my friends getting all the guys while I went pretty much unnoticed. It was good to be seen for once and not to be overlooked for my shyness. I was a little taken with Kody right off the bat. He was definitely cute, and had a great attitude. He was talkative and engaged me in conversation, and made me feel comfortable around him. Neither courting nor dating were on my mind at that point. He was the brother of a good friend, and that was how we began our friendship.<br> <br>The next day Kody and Christy came to meet me as I got off my shift at my job at a portrait studio in the mall. The three of us went to lunch and then to an evening get-together. I felt comfortable around them, as if I&#x2019;d fallen into a new and safe friendship.<br> <br>Over the next few days, I began discovering what a fun guy Kody was. He was always laughing and smiling. He had a good attitude and a positive outlook on life. He really was outgoing and positive. I was impressed with the strength of his convictions and the depth of his spirituality. After knowing him for just a few days, I found myself liking to be around him and spending time with him, and wondering what direction this new relationship would take. One night, while his sister was still in town, we went to the home of some friends of his family for a party. There were quite a few people there, but every once in a while I would catch Kody looking at me. When our eyes met, he&#x2019;d give me a little smile. It made my heart race. Unfortunately, a few days later, Christy returned to Wyoming. Since she was the reason I&#x2019;d been hanging out with Kody in the first place, I didn&#x2019;t really think that he and I would see each other as much as we had been.<br> <br>Thankfully, I was wrong. The next week, Kody and I continued running into each other at church events. Eventually he asked my dad if it would be okay if the two of us went out to grab a bite to eat. I know it seems pretty old-fashioned that a young man would need my father&#x2019;s permission to go out with me, but our faith has specific morals to uphold and protocols to follow. Therefore, out of respect for me and my dad, Kody wanted to request my father&#x2019;s permission for our association. Anyway, there was something flattering about a young man going to the trouble of getting my father&#x2019;s approval before taking me out.<br> <br>My father was an excellent judge of character and warmed to Kody immediately. My dad had a good handle on people. He had no problem with Kody and me &#x201c;hanging out,&#x201d; which soon became the description we jokingly used for our relationship. He knew me well enough to know that we would be appropriate with each other, and knew he had nothing to worry about in my new relationship. Now that we had my father&#x2019;s approval, Kody and I could get to know each other in earnest.<br> <br>Maybe it was because of me or maybe it was purely because of his growing interest in our faith (I like to think it was a combination of the two), but Kody started spending more and more time associating with people from our church. I usually found myself somewhere nearby. Kody was, and always has been, a loud and enthusiastic presence. It is hard to miss him in a crowd. Back then, I was quickly learning that Kody is the guy everybody wants to know and be around.<br> <br>At first when people noticed us hanging out together they would ask Kody if I was his sister. I had been a member of this church since I was five years old, but I was so quiet and shy that many people had simply not noticed me. Now that I was spending time with Kody, people began to take notice.<br> <br>Before Kody arrived in our group, I had been a wallflower. Now I began coming out of my shell. It was nice, but it was strange. I was experiencing the people and places that had been most familiar to me in a whole new light. I was participating instead of standing on the sidelines. I was spending more and more time with him and starting to hope that our relationship would go beyond friendship.<br> <br>But then, Kody broke my heart.<br> <br>After we had known each other for a few weeks, when I could no longer deny that I was falling for him, Kody came over to my house. We were sitting on the couch, waiting for my mom to get home. Kody really enjoyed my mom&#x2019;s company and wanted to spend some time with her, which pleased me and gave me hope that things were becoming more serious between us. This hope was short-lived.<br> <br>At the precise moment I&#x2019;d expected him to make some sort of declaration to me, or at least hint at his feelings toward me, he said, &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t get involved in any relationships with girls right now. I like our friendship, let&#x2019;s continue that.&#x201d;<br> <br>I was devastated. But I fought not to let it show.<br> <br>&nbsp;<br> Kody<p></p> <br>I&#x2019;m a hopeless romantic and too easily infatuated. When I was growing up, I suffered all sorts of little heartbreaks. I had a careless dating style. I would dive into a relationship before considering my true feelings. Often I&#x2019;d find myself holding a girl&#x2019;s hand, then I&#x2019;d look over at her and think: Why am I holding her hand? I don&#x2019;t really like her.<br> <br>During my two years in the ministry in Texas, I promised myself that I would never again kiss a woman until I knew for sure that I was in love. When I returned home from my mission and began seriously considering converting from the LDS church to Mormon fundamentalism, my mother told me that I should take time away from girls, or at least from dating them. She knew that I needed to become less careless and discover what it was I truly wanted from a relationship and whom I truly loved. My mother sat me down and said, &#x201c;The next time you find yourself infatuated with someone, why don&#x2019;t you just try and be friends? Don&#x2019;t rush into a romantic relationship right off the bat. Be friends and let something develop.&#x201d;<br> <br>That decided it. I told myself I was done with dating carelessly. I was done chasing girls. I urged myself to be patient and to learn how to be friends with the next girl I became interested in. Meri was my experiment in friends!<br> <br>Meri was so cute and sweet when I met her that I had a hard time suppressing my hopelessly romantic nature. She had a remarkable purity about her. I had a sneaking suspicion that we were soul mates, but because of the promise I had made to myself, I rejected this notion. I was determined to be Meri&#x2019;s friend until I knew her better and could confirm my suspicion that our destinies were intertwined. I was glad that Meri and I kept finding ourselves spending more and more time together.<br> <br>I was excited to be associating with members of Meri&#x2019;s faith. They had an intensity about religion that I found inspiring. Perhaps because their religion was somewhat countercultural and at odds with certain conventional doctrines, they took no aspect of their belief for granted. They examined their convictions carefully and enthusiastically. The members of this group were fully committed to their ideologies and discussed them at length, both debating and confirming the tenets of their religion. Every day I spent with this group seemed to turn into an impromptu revival with profound discussions of spirituality and religion that I&#x2019;d been missing in the LDS church. Even though I loved my new group of friends and their congregation, I hadn&#x2019;t yet determined whether I should join the faith.<br> <br>Nevertheless, I kept surrounding myself with people from my parents&#x2019; new church. A few weeks after I told Meri that I wasn&#x2019;t open to dating, I invited her up to my parents&#x2019; ranch in Wyoming for Thanksgiving. Meri and I were never far from each other&#x2019;s side during that trip. Naturally, people began to ask if we were dating. It was pretty clear that we liked each other a whole lot more than just &#x201c;friends.&#x201d; I often caught Meri making eyes at me. I didn&#x2019;t have to ask her how she felt about me&#x2014;it was written all over her face. I couldn&#x2019;t stop winking back at her from time to time. It was no longer possible for me to deny that I had strong feelings for Meri. She was sweet and innocent, and a wond...</p><h2>Thoughts for Young Men: Updated Edition with Study Guide</h2><p><strong></strong><p><b><strong>Biblical, Timeless, Practical Advice for Young Men </strong></b></p><p><b><br></b></p><p><em><strong>Named one of the &#x201c;20 Best Christian Books for Men&#x201d; by TheBlazingCenter.com.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>&#x201c;J.

Pastor and author J.C. Ryle (1816-1900) asked a similar question more than a century ago in Thoughts for Young Men as he observed the spiritual condition of young men in the culture. </p><p>Young men, he noted, are the least likely to be involved in church but the most likely to cause their parents heartache. They&#x2019;re also the most likely to being involved in drunkenness, crimes and gangs.</p><p>&#x201c;How dreadful this is!&#x201d; Ryle wrote.</p><p>But Ryle said there is hope. In his popular book <em>Thoughts for Young Men</em>, Ryle warns young men about the dangers of the world -- pride, pleasure, contempt of true Christianity and the fear of man&#x2019;s opinion, among them -- while giving biblical, practical advice for living a godly life. </p><p><strong>Among his words of wisdom:</strong> </p><p>-- Go to Christ with your problems. &#x201c;He knows by experience a young man&#x2019;s mind.&#x201d;</p><p>-- Choose your friends carefully. &#x201c;The devil has few better helps in ruining a man&#x2019;s soul.&#x201d;</p><p>-- Take seriously the Bible&#x2019;s warnings about sexual immorality. &#x201c;It is a sin that slays its thousands in every age, and has overthrown more than a few of the saints of God in the past.&#x201d;</p><p>-- Don&#x2019;t worry what the world thinks. &#x201c;Can man save your soul? No. Will man be your judge in the great and dreadful day of judgment? No.&#x201d;</p><p>Thoughts for Young Men is for young men who desire to live for God ... but are tempted by the lusts of the world. It also is for young men who are caught up in the things of the world ... but need to hear the voice of God. <strong>It is the perfect book for personal study ... and for small groups too.</strong> &nbsp;</p><p>It is a must-read for this generation and for every generation.</p><p>Get this book <em>now</em> and learn how to become a more devoted disciple of the Most High.</p><strong></strong></p><p>John Charles Ryle (10 May 1816 &#x2013; 10 June 1900) was the first Anglican bishop of Liverpool. Ryle was a strong supporter of the evangelical school and a critic of Ritualism. He was a writer, pastor and an evangelical preacher. Among his longer works are Christian Leaders of the Eighteenth Century (1869), Expository Thoughts on the Gospels (7 vols, 1856&#x2013;69), Principles for Churchmen (1884). Ryle was described as having a commanding presence and vigorous in advocating his principles albeit with a warm disposition. He was also credited with having success in evangelizing the blue collar community.<i>Named one of Desiring God's top "recommended" books for young people.</i><br><br>"This book isn't just for young men.

Wouldn't you fall right through and smack onto the ground? Like Frankie always says, angels have wings, so what do they have to worry about?</p><p>My idea of Heaven has nothing to do with clouds or angels. In my Heaven there's butter pecan ice cream and swimming pools and baseball games. The Brooklyn Dodgers always win, and I have the best seat in the house, right behind the Dodgers' dugout. That's the only advantage that I can see to being dead: You get the best seat in the house.</p><p>I think about Heaven a lot. Not because of the usual reasons, though. I'm only eleven, and I don't plan on dying until I'm at least a hundred. It's just that I'm named after that Bing Crosby song "Pennies from Heaven," and when you're named after something, you can't help but think about it.</p><p>See, my father was crazy about Bing Crosby, and that's why everyone calls me Penny instead of Barbara Ann Falucci, which is what's on my birth certificate. No one ever calls me Barbara, except teachers, and sometimes even I forget that it's my real name.</p><p>I guess it could be worse. I could be called Clementine, which was the name of another Bing Crosby song that my father really liked.</p><p>I don't think I'd make a very good Clementine. Then again, who would?<br></p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>The Lucky Bean<br></p><p>Uncle Dominic is sitting in his car.</p><p>It's a 1940 Plymouth Roadking. It's black with chrome trim, and the hubcaps are so shiny, you could use them as a mirror. Uncle Dominic pays my cousin Frankie to shine them up. It's an awfully nice car; everybody says so. But then, it's kind of hard to miss. It's been parked in the side yard of my grandmother Falucci's house for as long as I can remember.</p><p>Uncle Dominic lives right there in his car. Nobody in the family thinks it's weird that Uncle Dominic lives in his car, or if they do, nobody ever says anything. It's 1953, and it's not exactly normal for people in New Jersey to live in cars. Most people around here live in houses. But Uncle Dominic's kind of a hermit. He also likes to wear slippers instead of shoes. Once I asked him why.</p><p>"They're comfortable," he said.</p><p>Besides living in the car and wearing slippers, Uncle Dominic's my favorite uncle, and I have a lot of uncles. Sometimes I lose track of them.</p><p>"Hey, Princess," Uncle Dominic calls.</p><p>I lean through the window and hear the announcer on the portable radio. Uncle Dominic likes to listen to ball games in the car. There's a pillow and a ratty-looking blanket on the backseat. Uncle Dominic says the car's the only place he can get any rest. He has a lot of trouble falling asleep.</p><p>"Hi, Uncle Dominic," I say.</p><p>"Game's on," he says.</p><p>I start to open the back door, but Uncle Dominic says, "You can sit up front."</p><p>Uncle Dominic's very particular about who's allowed to sit in his car. Most people have to sit in the back, although Uncle Nunzio always sits up front. I don't think anyone ever tells Uncle Nunzio what to do.</p><p>"Who's winning?" I ask.</p><p>"Bums are ahead."</p><p>I love the Brooklyn Dodgers, and so does Uncle Dominic. We call them Dem Bums. Most people around here like the New York Yankees or the Giants, but not us.</p><p>Uncle Dominic is staring out the window, like he's really in the ballpark and watching the game from the bleachers. He's handsome, with dark hair and brown eyes. Everyone says he looks just like my father. I don't remember my father because he died when I was just a baby, but I've seen photographs, and Uncle Dominic does look like him, except sadder.</p><p>"Got something for you," Uncle Dominic says.</p><p>All my uncles give me presents. Uncle Nunzio gives me fur muffs, and Uncle Ralphie gives me candy, and Uncle Paulie brings me fancy perfumes, and Uncle Sally gives me horseshoes. It's like Christmas all the time.</p><p>Uncle Dominic hands me something that looks like a big dark-brown bean.</p><p>"What is it?"</p><p>"It's a lucky bean," he says. Uncle Dominic is superstitious. "Just found it this morning. It was packed away with some old things. I got it for your father before he died, but I never had a chance to give it to him. I want you to have it."</p><p>"Where'd you get it?" I ask.</p><p>"Florida," he says.</p><p>Uncle Dominic loves Florida and goes to Vero Beach every winter, probably because it's too cold to live in the car then. Even though he lives in this car, he has another car that he uses for driving, a 1950 Cadillac Coupe de Ville. Frankie says he bets Uncle Dominic has a girl down in Florida, but I kind of don't think so. Most women want a new Frigidaire, not a backseat.</p><p>"Put it in your pocket," he says. "It'll keep you safe."</p><p>The lucky bean is big and lumpy. It feels heavy, not the kind of thing to put in a pocket, but Uncle Dominic has this look about his eyes like he might just die if I don't, and because he is my favorite uncle, I do what I always do.</p><p>I smile and say, "Thanks, Uncle Dominic."</p><p>For a moment the strain leaves his eyes.</p><p>"Anything for you, Princess," he says. "Any-thing."<br></p><p>It's a hot, sticky June day. School is out, and for the first time in months I don't have to worry about Veronica Goodman being mean to me. I used to like school, until this year. I probably wouldn't have survived if Mrs. Ellenburg, the librarian, hadn't let me hide out in the library. Lucky for me, Veronica Goodman doesn't like to read.</p><p>The lucky bean rubs in my pocket as I walk down the street toward my house. I live with my mother and my other grandparents, Me-me and Pop-pop, and my poodle, Scarlett O'Hara. Even though she's named after a famous lady in a boring movie, Scarlett O'Hara isn't very ladylike. Scarlett has bad breath and likes to chase squirrels and has taken to tinkling on the good carpet in the parlor lately, not to mention other things she shouldn't be doing.</p><p>Pop-pop's sitting in the parlor when I get home. He's listening to the radio and has got it turned up loud enough that the whole neighborhood can hear it. His favorite program is Fibber McGee and Molly, although he'll sleep through just about any program these days. We don't have a television set because Me-me says they're too expensive, which means they'll probably buy one right after I graduate high school and move out.</p><p>"I'm back," I announce.</p><p>"What's that?" he asks.</p><p>"I said, 'I'm back,' Pop-pop," I say loudly.</p><p>"What?" he asks. "What?"</p><p>Pop-pop's a little deaf. Me-me says he's been deaf ever since 1918, when he came home from Europe with shrapnel in his leg. She says he left the best part of him somewhere in France, along with his ability to listen to anyone.</p><p>There's a bad smell in the room.</p><p>"Pop-pop, what's that smell?" I ask.</p><p>"Sure, I'll take an iced tea," he says.</p><p>I spot the little brown lump behind the love seat. It looks kind of like the lucky bean Uncle Dominic gave me. Scarlett O'Hara's nowhere in sight.</p><p>"Look what Scarlett did," I say.</p><p>"Darn animal," he grumbles. Pop-pop can hear okay when he wants to. "That dog of yours is sneakier than the Japs."</p><p>Even though we're in a war right now in Korea, Pop-pop still loves talking about World War II, especially Pearl Harbor and how the Japanese attacked us when we were sleeping. He says it's the worst thing that's ever happened on American soil. No one saw it coming.</p><p>"Downright cowardly is what it was," he always says.</p><p>I don't remember the war because I was too small, but I sure am glad we won. Eating breakfast in our house is tough enough without having to worry about being bombed by the Japanese.</p><p>"Penny!" Me-me calls from the kitchen.</p><p>We have a two-story house. Me-me and Pop-pop live in the top part and Mother and I live in the bottom. My grandparents have their own bedroom, bathroom, and parlor, but they take all their meals downstairs with us because there's just the one kitchen. In fact, Me-me does most of the cooking, since my mother has to work. She's a secretary at a truck factory.</p><p>Me-me is standing with her back to me, facing the stove, when I walk into the kitchen. Her hair is going gray, and she's got it up in a bun. She's wearing a cotton dress with a red cherry print. </p><p>Me-me loves colorful prints, and she also has a dress with cabbage roses, one with fruit segments, and another one with daisies. My favorite is the dress with the Hawaiian palm trees. I think it would be fun to go someplace like Hawaii. It's got to be more exciting than New Jersey.</p><p>I don't have to look in the pot she's stirring to know it's peas and onions. The smell fills the air. Me-me likes to boil vegetables until they are pure mush and every bit of flavor is gone. I didn't even know peas could be sweet until I tasted them fresh off the vine at my grandmother Falucci's house.</p><p>"What's for dinner?" I ask.</p><p>"Liver," she says, and I have to make myself not groan.</p><p>Me-me's liver is worse than her pot roast, which is worse than her beef Stroganoff, and you don't even want to know about her meat loaf.</p><p>"Set the table, please," Me-me says.</p><p>I take the green glass dishes out of the cabinet and carry them to the dining room, where there's just a table and chairs and a sideboard. On the sideboard is an old clock and a framed photograph of my mother and father on their wedding day. We don't talk about my father in this house because it upsets my mother. I guess she's never gotten over him dying like he did and leaving her with a baby. She used to be a nurse at the hospital where he was taken when he got sick, but she said after he died, she couldn't go back there, that there were too many sad memories.</p><p>In the wedding photograph, my father is wearing a dark suit, and his arm is around my mother's waist as if he's scared she's going to run away. My mother's wearing a white satin dress and carrying a bouquet of sweet peas. Her hair is long, past her shoulders, and curled like a movie star's. She's smiling at the camera like she's the luckiest girl in the world.</p><p>She looks so happy, I almost don't recognize her.<br></p><p>Me-me has been staring at the clock for the last half hour while Pop-pop and I watch the liver and peas and onions get cold. Scarlett O'Hara is sitting next to Pop-pop's chair, waiting for something to fall from his plate, which is usually a good bet.</p><p>Pop-pop takes a long slurp of iced tea and burps loudly. A moment later he burps again.</p><p>"Pop-pop!" I say.</p><p>"What?" he says with a scowl.</p><p>Honestly, I don't know which is more embarrassing--Scarlett O'Hara doing her business in the house or Pop-pop burping all the time. And Mother wonders why I never want to have friends over for a slumber party.</p><p>The front door opens, and Me-me straightens her shoulders and sits a little taller.</p><p>"Sorry I'm late, Mother," my mother says, unpinning her hat and slipping into her place at the table.</p><p>She's wearing a plain navy-blue suit and has wavy golden-brown hair, cut short, just below her ears. She uses Tangee rouge on her cheeks and a little bit of red lipstick. The Tangee rouge is the fanciest thing about her.</p><p>"Do you know what time it is, Eleanor?" Me-me asks, looking pointedly at the clock. "It's seven-thirty, that's what time it is. What kind of place is that man running?"</p><p>"Mr. Hendrickson had some last-minute dictation," my mother says.</p><p>Me-me looks at my plate and says, "Eat your peas, Penny."</p><p>I take a bite, forcing myself to swallow. They're just awful. They taste like something you would feed someone you were trying to torture.</p><p>Pop-pop is poking the liver with his fork. "I thought you said we were having steak," he complains. "This looks like liver."</p><p>"Hi, Bunny," my mother says to me, and I can hear the tiredness in her voice. "How was your day?"</p><p>Bunny is her nickname for me. She said she took one look at me in the hospital and I looked so small and sweet that she knew I was a bunny.</p><p>"Look what I got," I say. I dig in my pocket and pull out the lucky bean and put it on the flower-print tablecloth.</p><p>Pop-pop starts choking when he sees it. "Did you bring a dog turd to the table?"</p><p>Scarlett O'Hara barks as if to deny she has anything to do with it.</p><p>"It's a lucky bean," I explain. "Uncle Dominic gave it to me."</p><p>"Lucky bean?" Me-me scoffs. "The only lucky thing--"</p><p>"Mother," my mother says in a warning voice.</p><p>"Your father's people," Me-me says to me with a shake of her head. What she means is that they're Italian, and Catholic.</p><p>Me-me and Pop-pop are plain old American, and Methodist. They go to church every Sunday, and usually make me go too. My mother doesn't go to any church at all.</p><p>"Here's a good one, Penny," Pop-pop says. He loves jokes. "Why does the new Italian navy have glass-bottom boats?"</p><p>"Why?"</p><p>"To see the old Italian navy!" he hoots. "Get it? Their boats are at the bottom of the ocean!"</p><p>My mother looks down at her plate and sighs.</p><p>"Mother," I say, "Uncle Ralphie says he'll hire me and Frankie to work at the store a few days a week. Can I? It could be my summer job."</p><p>Uncle Ralphie is one of my father's brothers. He owns a butcher shop.</p><p>"What will you be doing?" she asks.</p><p>"Sweeping up, stacking, delivering groceries."</p><p>"Deliver groceries to strange people's houses? You're a young girl," Me-me says, sounding appalled.</p><p>"I don't think so, Penny," Mother says, which is what she always says.</p><p>My mother's afraid of just about everything that involves fun. I can't go swimming because there might be polio in the public pool. I can't go to the movie theater because I might catch polio there, too. I can't go on the bumper cars because I could hurt my neck. Don't do this, Penny! Don't do that, Penny! It's too dangerous, Penny! Any-thing could happen, Penny! Sometimes I want to say that the most dangerous thing in my life is Me-me's cooking.</p></p><h2>Playtown: Emergency: A Lift-the-Flap book</h2><p>Playtown emergency services are always busy, working hard to keep the people of Playtown safe!

Many of these historical stories are familiar to readers of the New Testament but dozens are new, including the missing years not found in the Bible. Here you discover Jesus presented as never before, both as divine Son and human hero whose matchless life inspires, comforts, and transforms you.</p> <p>It is beautifully written in modern, page-turning prose and complemented with 106 paintings from 35 renowned artists, including 42 originally commissioned works you will see for the first time. The paintings run the gamut of fine art celebrating the life of Christ, both classic and modern. These artists poured their souls into these portraits of higher spiritual reality. Our deep appreciation and humble gratitude go out to each one of them.</p> <p>These paintings illustrate Jesus&#x2019; life journey from his humble birth and childhood to adolescence and manhood; from private to public ministry and on to his death, resurrection, and ascension. The artwork celebrates his diverse life as son, father-brother, carpenter, boat designer and builder, tutor, translator, caravan conductor, teacher, healer, minister, and friend. No one knows what Jesus looked like, but these artists painted their soulful interpretations to spark our imagination of these scenes from the Master&#x2019;s life. Our intent is to give you a visual communion with Jesus that complements the enthralling narrative.</p> <p>This impeccably designed book provides relevant and empowering spiritual insights, helping you navigate the challenging yet promising conditions of the 21st century. We live in an exciting era of unprecedented improvements in our material lives brought about by scientific, industrial, and social achievements. Yet despite all this progress, many souls feel lonely and displaced. We need God and have an innate thirst for spiritual answers because of that &#x201c;still, small voice&#x201d; that lives within us. Finding God by living the personal religion of Jesus satisfies that thirst.</p> <p>The search for the genuine Jesus continues to intrigue humanity. Since the Bible only records an estimated 50 days of his life, it follows that there is more to his story. You will find it here in this detailed history of the Master&#x2019;s entire life, including the public ministry recorded in the Gospels. It provides a coherent and seamless biography of this magnificent personality who continues to shape spiritual progress in our world.</p> <p>The story of Jesus is one of the most enthralling chapters in human history. The closing passage of the Apostle John&#x2019;s gospel speaks to a life larger than even the world itself. How fitting that the last words of his gospel should be the first words of this book: &#x201c;But there are also many things which Jesus did; were every one of them to be written, I suppose that the world itself would not contain the books that would be written.&#x201d; In John&#x2019;s day the Word was made flesh. In these days the Word is made book.</p> <p><i>The Untold Story of Jesus</i> reveals the living Christ to members of the church that bears his name, as well as to worshipers of all world religions. It is sure to become a favorite volume for all who seek God.</p> <p><strong>A Final Thought</strong></p> <p>We pray that these stories, teachings, and paintings provide you with a new sense of faith, comfort, and purpose. And to you who may not believe in Jesus, we ask you to look again. Read the stories, enjoy the art, and get to know the man through new eyes.</p> <p>What the world needs now is unconditional love, unfailing compassion, and matchless goodwill. Even after two thousand years, Jesus&#x2019; teachings have not been practiced on a global scale. When that day comes, his inspired life will transform, transfigure, and rule this world. His message of personal faith in a loving heavenly Father coupled with unselfish service to one another is a clear and direct pathway to peace in this life and passage to the next. May you be blessed by the supreme adventure that follows!</p> <p>&#x201c;Of all human knowledge, that which is of greatest value is to know the religious life of Jesus and how he lived it.&#x201d;</p> <p><strong>About the Authors</strong></p> <p>The book was produced by Mo Siegel and Jim English and edited by a team of Urantia Book scholars headed by MaryJo Garascia.

His sympathetic heart embraced all mankind, even a universe.</p> <p>&#x201c;Be of good cheer.&#x201d;</p> <p>This man of Galilee was not a man of sorrows; he was a soul of gladness. He could maintain this confident attitude because of his unswerving trust in God and his unshakable confidence in man. He was always touchingly considerate of all men because he loved them and believed in them.</p> <p>&#x201c;Behold, I stand at the door and knock, and if any man will open, I will come in.&#x201d;</p> <p>Jesus taught that God is approachable, the Father is attainable, and the way is open to any hungry soul who desires to know God and become like him.</p> <p>&#x201c;My love overshadows you, my spirit will dwell with you, and my peace shall abide upon you.&#x201d;</p> <p>The peace of Jesus is the peace and assurance of a person who fully believes that his career for time and eternity is safely and wholly in the care and keeping of an all-wise, all-loving, and all-powerful spirit Father. This is the peace which surpasses all understanding.</p> <p>&#x201c;The kingdom of God is within you.&#x201d;</p> <p>Men seek for the treasures of the kingdom with yearning hearts and weary feet when they are all within the immediate grasp of living faith.</p></p><h2>New Testament with Psalms: Giant Print ESV</h2><p><p>Especially helpful for the elderly who attend Bible studies and classes, shut-ins who want to continue reading their Bibles at home, or nursing care home residents for their own private reading and group studies, New Testament with Psalms: Giant Print ESV brings God's Word in 16-point type.</p></p><p></p><h2>What&#39;s Happening to My Body?

It's the time for seeing her apple tree start to grow, for watching her friend Margaret go crazy with spring cleaning, and for going on the school trip to Plimoth Plantation. Clementine is ready for Ye Olden Times, but she isn't so sure about surviving lunch there-the fourth graders have strict rules about no eating sounds. (What <i>is</i> snicking, anyway? ) If that wasn't enough, Clementine also faces the challenges of learning Olive-language and surviving The Cloud on Bus 7.<br><br>Hearing the pilgrim lady talk about why she made the long journey from England makes Clementine think about rules. Who makes them, and what do they mean to the people who have to live with them? Today Clementine has to decide which rules are made to be broken. <br></p><p>Sara Pennypacker (www.sarapennypacker.com) was a painter before becoming a writer, and has two absolutely fabulous children who are now grown. She has written several books, including <em>Clementine, </em><em>The Talented Clementine</em>, <em>Clementine's Letter</em>, <em>Clementine, Friend of the Week</em>, and <em>Clementine and the Family Meeting</em>, all illustrated by Marla Frazee. She grew up in Massachusetts and now divides her time between Cape Cod and St. Petersburg, Florida.<br>Marla Frazee (www.marlafrazee.com) illustrated all of the books in the <em>Clementine </em>series. She is the author/illustrator of <em>The Boss Baby;</em> <em>Walk On!;</em> <em>Santa Claus, the World's Number One Toy Expert;</em> <em>Roller Coaster,</em> and<em> Boot and Shoe</em>. She is also a two time Caldecott Honoree, for <em>All the World</em> by Liz Garton Scanlon, and her own <em>A Couple of Boys Have the Best Week Ever</em> . Marla works in a small backyard cabin under an avocado tree in Pasadena, California.In her sixth book, changes continue for Clementine: her mother&#39;s belly is growing bigger, the fourth graders continue their reign of terror over the lunchroom (no crunching of any food!), neighbor Margaret&#39;s mother is getting married again, the third grade is going to Plimoth Plantation (and has to eat with the fourth graders!), and new girl Olive is stealing some of our heroine&#39;s thunder. Add to that the mystery of the ungodly stench on Bus 7 (which is assigned to Clementine&#39;s class for the field trip) and we have classic Clementine. Not only does she solve the mystery of the smelly bus but she also figures out why fussy Margaret is so neurotic and realizes that a new student might be a new friend. Clementine&#39;s voice is growing more sophisticated as she gets older, but it&#39;s still true to her age and her fans&#39; ages, too. When Margaret finally agrees to join the rebellion and almost crunch her food, Clementine&#39;s description is hilarious: &#34;Margaret&#39;s bite sounded like a moth&#39;s footstep. It sounded like a moth&#39;s footstep if the moth was crossing a carpet. And wearing socks.&#34; Clementine&#39;s family, too, is the kind that readers will want to be a part of-they take care of and love one another without being cloying. robin l. smith Horn Book&#34;</p><h2>Bloom (The Overthrow)</h2><p><b>The first book in a can't-put-it-down, can't-read-it-fast-enough action-thriller trilogy that's part <i>Hatchet,</i> part&nbsp;<i>Alien!<br></i></b><br>The invasion begins--but not as you'd expect.

She lives in asmall mountain town in Oregon and is happiest when lost in a good book,lost in the woods, or writing her next novel.The Wicked Deep <br> <br> ONE<p></p> <br>I have an old black-and-white photograph taken in the 1920s of a woman at a traveling circus floating in a massive tank filled with water, blond hair billowing around her head, legs hidden by a false mermaid&#x2019;s fin made of metallic fabric and thread to look like scales. She is wispy and angelic, with thin lips pinched tightly together, holding her breath against the icy water. Several men stand in front of the glass tank, staring at her as if she were real. So easily fooled by the spectacle.<br> <br>I think of this photograph every spring, when murmurs begin to circulate through the town of Sparrow about the three sisters who were drowned beyond the maw of the harbor, past Lumiere Island, where I live with my mother. I imagine the three sisters floating like delicate ghosts in the dark shadows beneath the water&#x2019;s surface, mercurial and preserved just like the sideshow mermaid. Did they struggle to stay above the waterline two centuries ago, when they were forced into the deep, or did they let the weight of each stone carry them swiftly to the cold, rocky bottom of the Pacific?&#x2019;<br> <br>A morning fog, somber and damp, slides over the surface of the ocean between Lumiere Island and the town of Sparrow. The water is calm as I walk down to the dock and begin untying the skiff&#x2014;a flat-bottomed boat with two bench seats and an outboard motor. It&#x2019;s not ideal for maneuvering in storms or gales but fine as a runner into town and back. Otis and Olga, two orange tabby cats who mysteriously appeared on the island as kittens two years back, have followed me down to the water, mewing behind me as if lamenting my departure. I leave every morning at this time, motoring across the bay before the bell rings for first period&#x2014;Global Economics class, a subject that I will never use&#x2014;and every morning they follow me to the dock.<br> <br>The intermittent beam of light from the lighthouse sweeps over the island, and for a moment it brushes across a silhouette standing on the rocky western shore atop the cliff: my mother. Her arms are crossed in her knobby camel-colored sweater wrapped tightly around her fragile torso, and she&#x2019;s staring out at the vast Pacific like she does each morning, waiting for someone who will never return: my father.<br> <br>Olga rubs up against my jeans, arching her bony back and raising her tail, coaxing me to pick her up, but I don&#x2019;t have time. I pull the hood of my navy-blue rain slicker up over my head, step into the boat, and yank the cord on the motor until it sputters to life, then steer the boat out into the fog. I can&#x2019;t see the shore or the town of Sparrow through the dim layer of moisture, but I know it&#x2019;s there.<br> <br>* * *<br> <br>Tall, sawtooth masts rise up like swords from the water, land mines, shipwrecks of years past. If you didn&#x2019;t know your way, you could run your boat into any of the half-dozen wrecks still haunting these waters. Beneath me lies a web of barnacle-crusted metal, links of rusted chain trailing over broken bows, and fish making their homes in rotted portholes, the rigging long since eaten away by the salty water. It&#x2019;s a graveyard of ships. But like the local fishermen chugging out through the dreary fume into the open sea, I can navigate the bay with my eyes pinched shut against the cold. The water is deep here. Massive ships used to bring in supplies through this port, but not anymore. Now only small fishing boats and tourist barges sputter through. These waters are haunted, the seamen still say&#x2014;and they&#x2019;re right.<br> <br>The skiff bumps against the side of dock eleven, slip number four, where I park the boat while I&#x2019;m in class. Most seventeen-year-olds have driver&#x2019;s licenses and rusted-out cars they found on Craigslist or that were handed down from older siblings. But instead, I have a boat. And no use for a car.<br> <br>I sling my canvas bag over my shoulder, weighted down with textbooks, and jog up the gray, slick streets to Sparrow High School. The town of Sparrow was built where two ridges come together&#x2014;tucked between the sea and mountains&#x2014;making mudslides all too common here. One day it will likely be washed away completely. It will be pushed down into the water and buried beneath forty feet of rain and silt. There are no fast-food chains in Sparrow, no shopping malls or movie theaters, no Starbucks&#x2014;although we do have a drive-through coffee hut. Our small town is sheltered from the outside world, trapped in time. We have a whopping total population of two thousand and twenty-four. But that number increases greatly every year on June first, when the tourists converge into town and overtake everything.<br> <br>Rose is standing on the sloping front lawn of Sparrow High, typing on her cell phone. Her wild cinnamon-red hair springs from her head in unruly curls that she loathes. But I&#x2019;ve always envied the lively way her hair cannot be tamed or tied up or pinned down, while my straight, nut-brown hair cannot be coaxed into any sort of bouncy, cheerful configuration&#x2014;and I&#x2019;ve tried. But stick-straight hair is just stick-straight hair.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re not ditching me tonight, are you?&#x201d; she asks when she sees me, tenting both eyebrows and dropping her cell into her once-white book bag that&#x2019;s been scribbled with Sharpie and colored markers so that it&#x2019;s now a collage of swirling midnight blues and grassy greens and bubblegum pinks&#x2014;colorful graffiti art that has left no space untouched. Rose wants to be an artist&#x2014;Rose is an artist. She&#x2019;s determined to move to Seattle and attend the Art Institute when we graduate. And she reminds me almost weekly of the fact that she doesn&#x2019;t want to go alone and I should come with her and be her roommate. To which I&#x2019;ve skillfully avoided committing since freshmen year.<br> <br>It&#x2019;s not that I don&#x2019;t want to escape this rainy, dreadful town, because I do. But I feel trapped, a weight of responsibility settled firmly over me. I can&#x2019;t leave my mother all alone on the island. I&#x2019;m all she has left&#x2014;the only thing still grounding her to reality. And perhaps it&#x2019;s foolish&#x2014;naive even&#x2014;but I also have hope that perhaps my father will return someday. He&#x2019;ll magically appear on the dock and stroll up to the house as if no time has passed. And I need to be here in case he does.<br> <br>But as our junior year comes to an end and our senior year approaches, I&#x2019;m forced to consider the rest of my life and the reality that my future might be right here in Sparrow. I might never leave this place. I might be stuck.<br> <br>I&#x2019;ll stay on the island, reading fortunes from the smeared remains of tea leaves in white porcelain cups just like my mom used to before Dad vanished and never came back. Locals would steer their boats across the harbor, sometimes in secret under a ghost moon, sometimes in the middle of the day because they had an urgent question they needed answered, and they&#x2019;d sit in our kitchen, fingers tapping on the wood-block table, waiting for Mom to tell them their fate. And afterward they&#x2019;d leave folded or crumpled or flattened bills on the table just before they left. Mom would slide the money into a flour tin she kept on the shelf next to the stove. And maybe this is the life I&#x2019;m destined for: sitting at the kitchen table, the sweet scent of chamomile or orange lavender tea settling into my hair, running my finger around the rim of a mug and finding messages in the swirling chaos of leaves.<br> <br>I&#x2019;ve glimpsed my own future in those leaves many times: a boy blowing in from across the sea, shipwrecked on the island. His heart beating wildly in his chest, his skin made of sand and wind. And my heart unable to resist. It&#x2019;s the same future I&#x2019;ve seen in every cup of tea since I was five, when my mom first taught me to decipher leaves. Your fate lies at the bottom of a teacup, she had often whispered to me before shooing me off to bed. And the idea of this future stirs inside me whenever I think about leaving Sparrow&#x2014;like the island is drawing me back, my fate rooted here.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not ditching if I never said I&#x2019;d go,&#x201d; I say in response to Rose&#x2019;s question.<br> <br>&#x201c;I won&#x2019;t allow you to miss another Swan party.&#x201d; She shifts her hips to the side, looping her right thumb around the strap of her book bag. &#x201c;Last year I was stuck talking to Hannah Potts until sunrise, and I won&#x2019;t do it again.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll think about it,&#x201d; I say. The Swan party has always served a double purpose: the start of the Swan season and also the end-of-the-school-year bash. It&#x2019;s a booze-fueled celebration that is an odd mix of excitement to be free of classes and teachers and pop quizzes, blended with the approaching dread of the Swan season. Typically, people get way too smashed and no one remembers any of it.<br> <br>&#x201c;No thinking, just doing. When you think about things too long, you just talk yourself out of them.&#x201d; She&#x2019;s right. I wish I wanted to go&#x2014;I wish I cared about parties on the beach. But I&#x2019;ve never felt comfortable at things like this. I&#x2019;m the girl who lives on Lumiere Island, whose mom went mad and dad went missing, who never hangs out in town after school. Who would rather spend her evening reading tide charts and watching boats chug into port than chugging beers with people I barely know.<br> <br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t even have to dress up if you don&#x2019;t want to,&#x201d; she adds. Dressing up was never an option anyway. Unlike most locals in Sparrow, who keep a standby early 1800s costume tucked away in the back of their closet in preparation for the yearly Swan party, I do not.<br> <br>The warning bell for first period rings, and we follow the parade of students through the main front doors. The hallway smells like floor wax and rotting wood. The windows are single-pane and drafty, the wind rattling the glass in the frames every afternoon. The light fixtures blink and buzz. None of the lockers close because the foundation has shifted several degrees off center. If I had known another town, another high school, I might find this place depressing. But instead, the rain that leaks through the roof and drips onto desks and hallway floors during winter storms just feels familiar. Like home.<br> <br>Rose and I don&#x2019;t have first period together, so we walk to the end of A Hall, then pause beside the girls&#x2019; bathroom before we part ways.<br> <br>&#x201c;I just don&#x2019;t know what I&#x2019;ll tell my mom,&#x201d; I say, scratching at a remnant of Blueberry Blitz nail polish on my left thumb that Rose made me paint on two weeks back at her house during one of our movie nights&#x2014;when she decided that to fit in as a serious art major in Seattle she needed to watch classic Alfred Hitchcock movies. As if scary black-and-white films would somehow anoint her as a serious artist.<br> <br>&#x201c;Tell her you&#x2019;re going to a party&#x2014;that you actually have a life. Or just sneak out. She probably won&#x2019;t even notice you&#x2019;re gone.&#x201d;<br> <br>I bite the side of my lip and stop picking at my nail. The truth is, leaving my mom alone for even one night makes me uneasy. What if she woke up in the middle of the night and realized I was no longer asleep in my bed? Would she think I had disappeared just like my dad? Would she go looking for me? Would she do something reckless and stupid?<br> <br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s stuck on that island anyway,&#x201d; Rose adds. &#x201c;Where&#x2019;s she going to go? It&#x2019;s not like she&#x2019;s just going to walk out into the ocean.&#x201d; She pauses and we both stare at each other: Her walking out into the ocean is precisely what I&#x2019;m afraid of. &#x201c;What I mean,&#x201d; Rose corrects, &#x201c;is that I don&#x2019;t think anything will happen if you leave her for one night. And you&#x2019;ll be back right after sunrise.&#x201d;<br> <br>I look across the hall to the open doorway of my first-period Global Economics class, where nearly everyone is already in their seats. Mr. Gratton is standing at his desk, tapping a pen on a stack of papers, waiting for the final bell to ring.<br> <br>&#x201c;Please,&#x201d; Rose begs. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the biggest night of the year, and I don&#x2019;t want to be the loser who goes solo again.&#x201d; A slight lisp trails over the word &#x201c;solo.&#x201d; When Rose was younger, she talked with a lisp. All her Ss sounded like Ths. In grade school, kids used to tease her whenever a teacher asked her to speak out loud in front of the class. But after regular visits to a speech therapist up in Newport three days a week during our first years of high school, suddenly it was like she stepped out of her old body and into a new one. My awkward, lisping best friend was now reborn: confident and fearless. And even though her appearance didn&#x2019;t really change, she now radiated like some beautiful exotic species of human that I didn&#x2019;t recognize, while I stayed exactly the same. I have this sense that someday we won&#x2019;t even remember why we were friends in the first place. She will float away like a brightly colored bird living in the wrong part of the world, and I will stay behind, gray-feathered and sodden and wingless.<br> <br>&#x201c;Fine,&#x201d; I relent, knowing that if I skip another Swan party she might actually disown me as her only friend.<br> <br>She grins widely. &#x201c;Thank God. I thought I was going to have to kidnap you and drag you there.&#x201d; She shifts her book bag higher onto her shoulder and says, &#x201c;See you after class.&#x201d; She hurries down the hall just as the final bell chimes from the tinny overhead speakers.<br> <br>Today is only a half day: first and second period, because today is also the last day of school before summer break. Tomorrow is June first. And although most high schools don&#x2019;t start their summer session so early, the town of Sparrow began the countdown months ago. Signs announcing festivals in honor of the Swan sisters have already been hung and draped across the town square and over storefront windows.<br> <br>Tourist season starts tomorrow. And with it comes an influx of outsiders and the beginning of an eerie and deadly tradition that has plagued Sparrow since 1823&#x2014;ever since the three Swan sisters were drowned in our harbor. Tonight&#x2019;s party is the start of a season that will bring more than just tourist dollars&#x2014;it will bring folklore and speculation and doubt about the town&#x2019;s history. But always, every year without fail or falter, it also brings death.</p><h2>The Rising of the Shield Hero Volume 07 (The Rising of the Shield Hero Series: Light Novel)</h2><p>Naofumi and his friends defeat the Spirit Tortoise after it rampages across the country.

From blooming tree-picked fruit to farm-raised eggs and fresh-churned butter, Big Mama used what was readily available to invent completely original treats. Adams treasured the moments when her mother, aunt, and Big Mama would bring her into the kitchen to let her dabble in the process as a rite of passage. Big Mama&#x2019;s recipes became the fabric of their family heritage. <i>Grandbaby Cakes</i> is Adams&#x2019;s love note to her family, thanking those who came before and passing on this touching tradition with 50 brilliant cakes.<br><br><i>Grandbaby Cakes</i> pairs charming stories of Big Mama&#x2019;s kitchen with recipes ranging from classic standbys to exciting adventures helpfully marked by degree of difficulty that will inspire your own family for years to come.

The intimidating Uncle Wolfe is an anthropologist who has dedicated his life to finding cryptids, mysterious creatures believed to be long extinct.</p><p><br>Roland Smith is the author of <i>Zach's Lie</i>, an ALA Quick Pick for Reluctant Readers; <i>Cryptid Hunters</i>; <i>Thunder</i><i> </i><i>Cave</i>;<i> Jaguar</i>; <i>The Last Lobo</i>; and <i>Sasquatch</i>. He lives outside of Portland, Oregon, with his wife Marie, who also writes children's books.Grade 5-8&#x2013;When their parents disappear, twins Marty and Grace, 13, are taken in by their Uncle Travis, who searches the world for supposedly mythical creatures. After a parachute fall from an airplane, the kids find themselves in the middle of the Congo, where a surviving dinosaur may still exist. While their conservationist uncle tries to rescue the children, an evil cryptid hunter who kills species rather than saving them pursues the creature. Marty and Grace each have distinct, if not terribly complex personalities, and their adventures are quite absorbing. The first part of the story moves fairly slowly as the characters and the concept of cryptozoology are introduced. Once the twins hit the jungle, though, things get exciting. Along with the atmospheric setting, narrow escapes, and ruthless villains, a couple of neat personal revelations are woven into the tale, affecting nearly everybody involved. Both kids show courage and ingenuity as they try to survive the wild and avoid being captured. Marty's photographic memory provides a vehicle for presenting many facts about the environment without detracting from the tale. Grace is more introverted as she conquers her fears and discovers a life-changing revelation about her past. With the intriguing plot and plenty of well-paced action, this novel has fine booktalk potential and makes a good choice for adventure fans.<i>&#x2013;Steven Engelfried, Beaverton City Library, OR</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Women want to be with a man who knows how to take the lead and make decisions; one who has strong personal boundaries and knows how to love her like...a man.</p> <p>Unfortunately, a lot of men have difficulty accepting the truth that many women prefer to be with a man who isn&#x2019;t afraid to stand up to them, who challenges them, and who refuses to be pushed around by women (or anything else for that matter). This is especially true of women who seek a more traditional male-female gender role dynamic in their romantic relationships.</p> <p>Even if a man knows how to attract women, cultivating a mind-blowing relationship with one requires a different set of skills entirely. Women want men who can make them feel secure &#x2013; men with strong boundaries and unwavering commitment.</p> <p>Sadly, most dating and relationship books rarely show men how to keep a woman happy without them having to sacrifice their manhood in the process.</p> <p><b>How to Understand Women and Pass Their Tests With <i>Unshakeable</i> Confidence</b></p> <p>Men around the world have no idea that the women they know and love are testing them.

Jenny.<br>To this extraordinary true story, Boylan brings the humorous, fresh voice that won her accolades as one of the best comic novelists of her generation. With her distinctive and winning perspective,<i> She?s Not There</i> explores the dramatic outward changes and unexpected results of life as a woman: Jenny fights the urge to eat salad, while James consumed plates of ribs; gone is the stability of ?one damn mood, all the damn time.?<br>While Boylan?s own secret was unusual, to say the least, she captures the universal sense of feeling uncomfortable, out of sorts with the world, and misunderstood by her peers. Jenny is supported on her journey by her best friend, novelist Richard Russo, who goes from begging his friend to ?Be a man? (in every sense of the word) to accepting her as an attractive, buoyant woman. ?The most unexpected thing,? Russo writes in his Afterword to the book, ?is in how Jenny?s story we recognize our shared humanity.?<br>As James evolves into Jennifer in scenes that are by turns tender, startling, and witty, a marvelously human perspective emerges on issues of love, sex, and the fascinating relationship between our physical and our intuitive selves. Through the clear eyes of a truly remarkable woman,<i> She?s Not There</i> provides a new window on the often confounding process of accepting ourselves.</p>"Beautifully crafted, fearless, painfully honest, inspiring and extremely witty. Jennifer Finney Boylan is an exquisite writer with a fascinating story and this combination has resulted in one of the most remarkable, moving and unforgettable memoirs in recent history."<br>---Augusten Burroughs, author of <i>Running With Scissors</i><br><br>"In addition to being a complete delight, this book should make us all question what we mean when we use the words love, marriage, and friendship. Jennifer Finney Boylan is a great gift to womanhood." <br>--Haven Kimmel, author of <i>A Girl Named Zippy</i></p><h2>Dangerous Minds: A Knight and Moon Novel</h2><p><b><i>NEW YORK TIMES</i> BESTSELLER � The irrepressibly charming duo of Emerson Knight and Riley Moon returns in another gripping mystery by #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Janet Evanovich.</b><br><br> Buddhist monk Wayan Bagus lost his island of solitude and wants to get it back. The island was about two hundred miles northeast of Samoa. It had a mountain, beaches, a rain forest, and a volcano. And now it&#x2019;s gone. Poof! Vanished without a trace.<br><br> Brilliant and boyishly charming Emerson Knight likes nothing better than solving an unsolvable, improbable mystery. And finding a missing island is better than Christmas morning in the Knight household. When clues lead to a dark and sinister secret that is being guarded by the National Park Service, Emerson will need to assemble a crack team for help. Since a crack team isn&#x2019;t available, he enlists Riley Moon and his cousin Vernon. Riley Moon has a Harvard business degree and can shoot the eyes out of a grasshopper at fifty feet, but she can&#x2019;t figure out how to escape the vortex of Emerson Knight&#x2019;s odd life. Vernon has been Emerson&#x2019;s loyal and enthusiastic partner in crime since childhood. He now lives in an RV behind Emerson&#x2019;s house.<br><br> Together, this ragtag, mismatched trio will embark on a worldwide investigation that will expose a conspiracy one hundred years in the making.</p><p><b>Janet Evanovich </b>is the #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of the Stephanie Plum series, the Knight and Moon series, the Fox and O&#x2019;Hare series, the Lizzy and Diesel series, the Alexandra Barnaby novels and Troublemaker graphic novel, and <i>How I Write: Secrets of a Bestselling Author</i>.ONE<br> &nbsp;<br><br>It was a little after one in the morning when Riley Moon stopped struggling to make sense of the spreadsheet in front of her. She scraped her chair back from her desk, stood, and gave up a sigh. She was in a small room in a large mansion in Washington, D.C., and was surrounded by boxes, laundry hampers, and black garbage bags filled with official papers. She&#x2019;d been hired to untangle the complicated financial affairs of the Knight family, who for generations had been brilliant at making money and pathetic at keeping records. Riley had been on the job for almost two months, and she&#x2019;d reached the conclusion that it would be best for everyone if she just set fire to the office and destroyed every available document. <br><br>Her curly red hair was a rat&#x2019;s nest from a recently acquired habit of raking her fingers through it. Her brown eyes felt bloodshot. She thought a martini would fix everything, but she didn&#x2019;t have the energy to make one. She had two degrees from Harvard, a cute nose, a nice family back in Texas, and no social life. The closest she came to having a guy in her life was her boss, Emerson Knight, a man known far and wide as an &#x201c;odd duck.&#x201d; True, he was rich, brilliant, and totally hot-looking, but that didn&#x2019;t alter the fact that he was quackers.<br><br> Emerson was the latest heir to the Knight fortune, and he had no interest in either making more money or keeping better records. He simply wanted to get his family&#x2019;s affairs in order so he could keep their many charitable trusts operating while he pursued a life of investigation.<br><br> Their backgrounds were worlds apart, Riley thought. Her father was the sheriff of a small, dusty county in&nbsp; north Texas. Her mother was a second grade teacher. Her modest childhood home had unfashionable, comfortable furniture, a small backyard that was fenced for the family dog, a kitchen table that seated seven, and a dining room table that could fit a tight ten but was only used for Thanksgiving dinner. Growing up she had to&nbsp; compete with her four brothers, so she knew how to shoot, throw&nbsp; a punch, hit a hardball, and cuss.<br><br> Riley glanced out her office&#x2019;s small window and considered her options. She could traipse downstairs, get&nbsp;into her black-and-white Mini Cooper, and drive home to her Georgetown apartment, or she could select one of the many guest bedrooms just down the hall and sleep here at the Knight mansion, Mysterioso Manor.<br><br>&#x201c;The answer is obvious,&#x201d; Emerson said, standing in shadow on the far side of the room. &#x201c;It would be more efficient for you to stay here.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Crap on a cracker!&#x201d; Riley said, whipping around, hand over her heart. &#x201c;You just scared the heck out of me. How long have you been standing there?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s an interesting question. On a quantum level, either always or never.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;And&nbsp; on the level we all live on except&nbsp; you?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;About twenty seconds. I was checking the security monitors and I saw that your office light was still on.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t reconcile money spent through your animal rights charitable trust with money received. You seem to have too much money, but I don&#x2019;t know where it came from.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Is that a dilemma?&#x201d; &#x201c;Yes!&#x201d;<br><br> Only one of many, Riley thought, looking at her boss. Emerson had a peculiar intelligence that set him apart from other brilliant people she&#x2019;d met. He was good at connecting the dots even when half the dots were missing. Unfortunately, he was also a charmingly annoying enigma with the right combination of charisma and resourcefulness&nbsp;to convince her of just about anything. And if that wasn&#x2019;t enough of a problem, he looked like a model for a romance novel cover. He was six feet two inches tall, with a lot of wavy black hair, smoldering dark eyes, and a hard-muscled, lean body. The dark hair and eyes were inherited from his Spanish mother. The muscle was the result of years of martial arts practice.<br><br>Riley agreed with Emerson that it would be more efficient for her to spend the night here. Problem was, the guest rooms were creepy. In fact, the whole mansion was creepy. It was a massive gray stone Gothic-Victorian architectural disaster with a wraparound porch, multiple chimneys, hidden passages, gargoyles, turrets, and lancet windows. It was filled with priceless bric-a-brac, elaborate woodwork, uncomfortable antique furniture, and heavy velvet drapes with gold tassels. Previous generations of eccentric Knights had lived in the mansion and filled it with their collected treasures, wives, and mistresses.<br><br> Riley was about to choose comfort over efficiency when Emerson&#x2019;s house security alarm screamed out, <i>&#x201c;Intrusion, intrusion, intrusion.&#x201d;<br></i><br> &#x201c;What the heck?&#x201d; Riley said, clapping her hands over her ears.<br><br> Emerson tapped a code into his smartphone. The noise stopped, and images from the house&#x2019;s security cameras appeared on the phone&#x2019;s&nbsp; screen.<br><br> &#x201c;Follow me,&#x201d; Emerson said. &#x201c;The game is afoot.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Really?&#x201d; Riley said. &#x201c;Someone just broke into your house and you&#x2019;re&nbsp; quoting Sherlock Holmes?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;It popped into my head. It seemed appropriate.&#x201d; &#x201c;Hiding in the closet and waiting for the police seems&nbsp;<i>more </i>appropriate.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;We would have a very long wait. The alarm system&nbsp; isn&#x2019;t connected to the police. I have my own top men who handle these sorts of problems.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Who?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Vernon.&#x201d;<br><br> Vernon was Emerson&#x2019;s cousin from Virginia who&#x2019;d taken up semi-permanent residence in a monster RV he kept parked behind the mansion. He was a big, good- natured guy who had a way with the ladies and preferred fishing to thinking.<br><br> &#x201c;If there was any danger, Vernon would be here,&#x201d; Emerson said. &#x201c;He has <i>unagi.</i>&#x201d;<br><br> <i>&#x201c; &#x2018;Unagi&#x2019;?&#x201d;<br></i><br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a state of total awareness. Only by achieving true <i>unagi </i>can you be prepared for any danger that&nbsp; might befall you.&#x201d;<br><br> Riley followed Emerson to the stairs, arming herself with a massive two-handed sword she&#x2019;d appropriated from a suit of armor guarding a bedroom.<br><br> &#x201c;First,&nbsp; Vernon&nbsp; doesn&#x2019;t&nbsp; have&nbsp; <i>unagi,</i>&#x201d;&nbsp; Riley&nbsp; said. &#x201c;And second, there&#x2019;s no such thing as <i>unagi. </i>You heard about it on an episode of <i>Friends.</i>&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;If there <i>is </i>an intruder I&#x2019;ll use my powers to cloud his mind so he won&#x2019;t&nbsp; see me,&#x201d;&nbsp; Emerson said.<br> &#x201c;Awesome. Great plan. And what about me?&#x201d; &#x201c;You&nbsp; have a big sword.&#x201d;<br><br> Riley mentally acknowledged that she did indeed have&nbsp; a big sword and that Emerson did have an uncanny talent for&nbsp; sneaking up on people.<br><br> They stopped on the second-floor landing and looked over the railing at a little man standing in the foyer below them. Bald head. Short. Asian ancestry. Orange monk&#x2019;s robe. Jesus sandals.<br> &#x201c;Hello, Wayan,&#x201d; Emerson called down to the&nbsp; little man.<br><br> The man raised his eyes and smiled. He put his palms together, fingers up, and bowed his head slightly in greeting. Emerson repeated the palms-together greeting and went&nbsp; down the stairs to meet&nbsp; him.<br><br> &#x201c;This is Wayan Bagus,&#x201d; Emerson said to Riley.&nbsp; &#x201c;He&#x2019;s&nbsp; the Buddhist monk I studied with during my voyage of discovery.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I thought your mentor was Thiru Kuthambai Siddhar.&#x201d; &#x201c;There are many paths to enlightenment,&#x201d; Emerson said. &#x201c;The Siddhar was also a mentor.&#x201d; Emerson turned&nbsp;to the little monk. &#x201c;How did you get here?&#x201d; &#x201c;I walked,&#x201d;&nbsp; Wayan&nbsp; Bagus said.<br><br> &#x201c;From Samoa?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I walked onto a boat. Then I walked onto a plane. <br><br>Then, when the plane landed in Virginia, I walked some more.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;How&nbsp; long did it take you?&#x201d; Riley asked.<br><br> Wayan Bagus smiled politely. &#x201c;Buddha tells the story of a granite mountain that reached many miles into the sky. Every hundred years it was wiped with a silk cloth held in the mouth of a bird until the mountain was worn away to nothing. So, not so long.&#x201d;<br><br> Riley suppressed a grimace and managed a tight smile. She didn&#x2019;t want to be rude, but, criminy, wasn&#x2019;t it bad enough she had to endure this philosophical baloney from Emerson?<br><br> &#x201c;I suppose everything is relative,&#x201d; Riley said to Wayan Bagus. &#x201c;Still, it had to have been a long, difficult trip. And how did you manage to get into the house once you found it?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;The universe provided a way. Also, the door was unlocked.&#x201d; He turned to Emerson. &#x201c;I need your help. The island I was using as a hermitage is missing. I think it was stolen.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Define &#x2018;missing,&#x2019; &#x201d; Emerson said.<br><br> &#x201c;Gone,&#x201d; Wayan Bagus said. &#x201c;Vanished without a trace.&#x201d; &#x201c;Islands normally don&#x2019;t go missing,&#x201d;<br> Emerson said. &#x201c;Nevertheless, it is missing just the same,&#x201d; Wayan Bagus&nbsp;said.<br><br> &#x201c;Fascinating,&#x201d; Emerson said. &#x201c;Where exactly did you see it last?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;It was right where I&#x2019;d left it. About two hundred miles north of Samoa.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;And what makes you suspect it&#x2019;s stolen and not just lost?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;For the love of Mike, Emerson,&#x201d; Riley said. &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t steal&#x2014;or lose, for that matter&#x2014;a whole&nbsp; island.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s exactly what makes it so intriguing,&#x201d; Emerson said.<br><br> &#x201c;Last month some men appeared on my island and told me I had to leave,&#x201d; Wayan Bagus said. &#x201c;When I objected they forcibly removed me and placed me on a different island. By the time I found my way back, my island was gone.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;What did these men look like?&#x201d; Emerson asked. &#x201c;Did you know any&nbsp; of them? Were&nbsp; they Samoans?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;They were wearing khaki shorts and funny hats. Only one man spoke to me, and he spoke in English. Another man gave me an injection, and I woke up hours later in the cargo hold of a boat.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Was there anything special about your island?&#x201d; Emerson asked.<br><br> &#x201c;I know of nothing that would be of extraordinary value. It was typical of the hundreds of uninhabited, unmapped islands around Samoa. It had a mountain and beaches and rain forests. It was a very nice place for a hermitage, except for the volcano.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m quite fond of volcanoes,&#x201d; Emerson said. <br><br>&#x201c;They are interesting,&#x201d; Wayan Bagus said, &#x201c;but I find&nbsp; the energy can be disruptive to meditation.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> When Wayan Bagus was comfortably settled in a third- floor guest room,&nbsp; Emerson&nbsp; and&nbsp; Riley&nbsp; made&nbsp; their&nbsp; way to the cavernous library, with its intricate parquet floor, hand-carved oak bookshelves, and a second-level balcony. Newspapers and magazines were neatly stacked on the floor, and half a dozen whiteboards were scattered about, covered with Emerson&#x2019;s cryptic notes.<br> Some of the notes were devoted to the tangled estate left behind when Emerson&#x2019;s father had died under mysterious circumstances the previous year. Most were simply concerned with whatever sparked Emerson&#x2019;s imagination, ranging from quantum physics to tarantula crossings. A weather-beaten Coleman tent had been erected in front of the massive stone fireplace. Buddhist prayer flags hung from a line stretched between the tent and the fireplace mantel.<br><br> Emerson crossed the room, climbed a rolling ladder, and inched his way along, looking for a specific book in the&nbsp; science section.<br><br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s almost two in the morning, and the crazy little monk is asleep in bed,&#x201d; Riley said. &#x201c;Why are we here in the library?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Wayan Bagus is many things,&#x201d; Emerson said. &#x201c;Crazy isn&#x2019;t one of them. His mental and emotional acuity are&nbsp;exceptional. If he says his island is missing, then it is most certainly missing.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;And we&#x2019;re&nbsp; going to help him find it.&#x201d; &#x201c; &#x2018;We&#x2019;?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m changing your&nbsp; job&nbsp; description&nbsp; to&nbsp; &#x2018;amanuensis&#x2019; so you can assist me in the search. You served as my amanuensis once before, and the results were excellent.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;We&nbsp; were almost killed!&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;The key word is &#x2018;almost.&#x2019; We survived, and, you have to admit, it was exhilarating. This will give us an opportunity to once again marry our abilities.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;It wasn&#x2019;t exhilarating. It was terrifying. And I don&#x2019;t know about the marry thing.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m using the term &#x2018;marry&#x2019; in the broad sense of the word, as in &#x2018;join together.&#x2019; I&#x2019;m brilliant and intuitive, and you&#x2019;re practical and have a driver&#x2019;s license.&nbsp; We&#x2019;re the perfect team.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Of course.&#x201d;<br><br> Emerson continued his search. &#x201c;I thought I should clarify,&#x201d; he said over his shoulder, &#x201c;because I recently read a book about body language and nonverbal cues, and I decided you find me irresistible.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;<i>What?&nbsp; </i>I don&#x2019;t&nbsp; think so.&nbsp; If&nbsp; anyone&nbsp; is irresistible here&nbsp;it&#x2019;s me.&#x201d;<br><br> Emerson paused, seeming to have found what he was looking for. &#x201c;The two aren&#x2019;t mutually exclusive, but we&nbsp;need to maintain the sanctity of the amanuensis-client relationship despite our deepening physical attraction.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Aha!&nbsp; So you <i>do&nbsp; </i>find me irresistible.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Not at all. &#x2018;Irresistible&#x2019; would indicate a lack of control, and I have&nbsp; control&nbsp; in spades.&#x201d;<br> Emerson reached for a book, his shirt rode up, and Riley sneaked a look at the bared skin and perfectly toned abs. She narrowed her eyes slightly and thought that she had pretty good control too. Otherwise her hands would be all over&nbsp; those abs.<br><br> &#x201c;Look through this book for&nbsp; the&nbsp; section on&nbsp; Samoa,&#x201d; Emerson said, passing Riley a copy of <i>National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration Nautical Maps of the Pacific. </i>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be right down.&#x201d;<br><br> By the time Emerson joined Riley at the desk, Riley had found the chapter. It was page after page of detailed maps, with information about water depths, latitudes and longitudes, natural and man-made hazards, currents, and anything else you would need to know if you wanted to navigate by boat through the Samoan island chain.<br><br> &#x201c;As your amanuensis, I have&nbsp; to tell you this is insane.&nbsp; A bunch of men wearing khaki clothes stole an island? I mean, who&#x2019;s&nbsp; your prime suspect? UPS?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br> Emerson flipped through the pages. &#x201c;We would have to consider UPS. They&#x2019;re always <i>losing </i>things.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;What of yours have they&nbsp; lost?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Ice skates. A volleyball.

Together this odd couple survives encounters with sea-faring pirates, raging rhinos in Africa, sword-wielding royalty in Europe, stick-eating panda bears in Asia, sharks in Australia, hungry penguins in Antarctica, and piranhas in South America--all before finally making it home to North America. A fantastically funny read-aloud about two unlikely friends and their epic journey around the world.</p><p><b>Drew Daywalt </b>is the author of the blockbuster #1 <i>New York Times </i>bestselling <i>The Day the Crayons Quit</i>, illustrated by Oliver Jeffers, for which he won the E.B. White Read Aloud Award. He also penned the bestselling companion book, <i>The Day the Crayons Came Home</i>, as well as <i>The Legend of Rock Paper Scissors</i>.<br><br><b>David Spencer </b>is an illustrator and designer with a background in licensing, product design and print media. In his spare time he gets overexcited at movies with big robots, loves drawing monsters, guys in capes and other silly things. He has a undying affinity for anything that lets him be loud in social settings and when he isn't drawing fun stuff he can be found helping his kids get into adventure wherever it may rear its head. <i>The Epic Adventures of Huggie &amp; Stick</i> is his debut picture book.K-Gr 2-Huggie, a blue stuffed rabbit, and the appropriately named Stick spend most of their time in Reese's backpack. But an unfortunate circumstance sends them both tumbling out of the satchel and into the ocean. Now the pair must travel across all of the continents to get back to their owner. Much like Daywalt's wildly popular The Day the Crayons Quit, this story is told through a series of letters or journal entries, with Stick giving an overly optimistic view of their day's adventure, followed by Huggie's less glowing take on what really happened. For example, on their stop in Africa, Stick comments on how much fun it was to be in a race, and how nice it was for a giant fish to offer them a ride in its mouth. Huggie clarifies on the following page that they were chased by a rhino, they jumped into the ocean to escape, and then were swallowed by a shark. This pattern is followed throughout, which may make it feel repetitive, though it is hilarious to see what new calamites have befallen the two. Spencer's illustrations are sharp and polished, while his cartoon-heavy character design keeps the tone comedic.

She lives in Boulder, Colorado.<br>A marketing trip from Miranda (Glad Monster, Sad Monster, p. 1309) that jiggity jigs off in time-honored nursery-rhyme fashion, but almost immediately derails into well-charted chaos. The foodstuffs--the fat pig, the red hen, the plump goose, the pea pods, peppers, garlic, and spice--are wholly reasonable in light of the author's mention of shopping at traditional Spanish mercados, which stock live animals and vegetables. Stevens transfers the action to a standard American supermarket and a standard American kitchen, bringing hilarity to scenes that combine acrylics, oil pastels, and colored pencil with photo and fabric collage elements. The result is increasing frazzlement for the shopper, an older woman wearing spectacles, hat, and purple pumps (one of which is consumed by her groceries). It's back to market one last time for ingredients for the hot vegetable soup she prepares for the whole bunch. True, her kitchen's trashed and she probably won't find a welcome mat at her supermarket hereafter, but all's well that ends well--at least while the soup's on.

While out walking, Sambo encounters four hungry tigers, and surrenders his colorful new clothes, shoes, and umbrella so they will not eat him. The tigers are vain and each thinks he is better dressed than the others. They chase each other around a tree until they are reduced to a pool of ghee (clarified butter).

Including the complete text of the original in an easy-toread format, a new chapter covering the passing of Rick Wright and the release of the group's final album, and 80 pages of images from Mason's archives plus new photos, <em>Inside Out</em> is a masterly rock memoir and an eye opener for both veteran fans and those just discovering the group.</p><p>Nick Mason first played with Roger Waters and Syd Barrett at the Regent Street Polytechnic in London in 1964, and they became Pink Floyd in 1965.The landmark British psychedelic band Pink Floyd's founding drummer limns the group, named after two early bluesmen, in a profusely illustrated coffee-table tome. The band's spacey arrangements, instrumentation, and light shows made it famous; the drug-burnout fate of original leader Syd Barrett, who was later institutionalized, helped, too. As Barrett's legend grew, his former colleagues moved the band closer to the rock mainstream and scored massive hits with such albums as <i>Dark Side of the Moon</i> and <i>The Wall</i>. Mason tracks the outfit's progress from the members' meeting in art school a la the Who, the Rolling Stones, the Kinks, and other revered British rockers. He details the band's journey from jazzy R &amp; B to the psychedelic explorations that eventually dominated its output. Given Pink Floyd's erstwhile association with mood-altering substances, the more recent story of band members' children's covert strategy to score at a concert is particularly piquant. Incisive, and freighted with pictures, this is a lush treat for the band's considerable fandom. <i>Mike Tribby</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Kennedy</h2><p>Colonel L. Fletcher Prouty, the former CIA operative known as &#x201c;X,&#x201d; offers a history-shaking perspective on the assassination of president John F. Kennedy. His theories were the basis for Oliver Stone&#x2019;s controversial movie <i>JFK</i>. Prouty believed that Kennedy&#x2019;s death was a coup d&#x2019;�tat, and he backs this belief up with his knowledge of the security arrangements at Dallas and other tidbits that only a CIA insider would know (for example, that every member of Kennedy&#x2019;s cabinet was abroad at the time of Kennedy&#x2019;s assassination). His discussion of the elite power base he believes controlled the U.S. government will scare and enlighten anyone who wants to know who was really behind the assassination of John F. Kennedy.</p><p>Academy Award-winning Oliver Stone has written and directed over 25 feature films and 6 documentaries, among them some of the most influential and iconic films of the last decades. Some have been at deep odds with conventional myth&#x2014; films such as Platoon, Born on the Fourth of July, JFK, Natural Born Killers, Nixon, and Untold History of the United States.<br><br><b>Jesse Ventura</b> is the former independent governor of Minnesota. He is also a former US Navy frogman, a professional wrestler, a movie actor, a visiting fellow at Harvard Kennedy School of Government, and the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of seven books, including <i>American Conspiracies</i>, <i>63 Documents the Government Doesn&#x2019;t Want You to Read</i>, and <i>Don&#x2019;t Start the Revolution Without Me!</i> He was the host and executive producer of truTV&#x2019;s <i>Conspiracy Theory with Jesse Ventura</i>, which won the Stony Award from <i>High Times</i> magazine in 2010. He was also the host of the political talk show <i>Off The Grid</i>, which aired on RT America and online at Ora.tv. He has a reputation as a rebel and a freethinker, and he has no qualms about questioning authority. He spends half the year in Baja, Mexico and the other half in his home state of Minnesota.Following Oliver Stone's JFK, Prouty (whom Stone depicted as ``X,'' Jim Garrison's secret informant on the military-industrial complex) offers an update on the assassination. Anyone new to assassination studies will find Prouty's many theses (not much different than those he discussed in The Secret Team, 1973) unsettling at the very least, and it seems unlikely that every single column of smoke Prouty points at has no fire at its base aside from a blaze of paranoia, especially when he is not given to paranoid phraseology. Here, he adds nothing new to the theories set forth by the Stone film, only spells them out. Prouty's point of view comes from his nine-year stint as a chief of special operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, carrying out secret operations against Vietnam and Cuba, among other countries. These ``Black Ops,'' which included infiltrating CIA teams into foreign countries and building up insurgencies, in many ways married the CIA to the military-industrial complex. Prouty outlines how the government has carried out policies meant to swell defense contracts while maintaining low-intensity wars since 1945; tells how, in that year, he watched US equipment stockpiled on Okinawa being shipped to Indochina, where we armed all sides for their upcoming conflicts--all support for his contention that there's an elite power-base behind the US government, which knowingly or unknowingly fulfills its needs. On the assassination, Prouty restates many themes whose familiarity and thinness of detail here in no way lessen their force. But one finds spotty scaffolding that brings into question whole sections of the assassination plot. Conspiracy? Perhaps. Carried out for the reasons Prouty suggests? Maybe. But does he present the facts? No, just theories. The big picture, in large strokes, by a man of unusual courage in going out on limbs. -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Crowe, the author of <i>Mississippi Trial</i> (2002), a YA novel about Till's story, begins this nonfiction account with the events that led to the murder: on a dare, Till allegedly flirted with a local white woman; several days later he was kidnapped by the woman's husband and other men. In accessible, succinct, and sometimes colloquial language, Crowe details what happened on the horrible night, the court proceedings, and how the nation responded-- the "aftershocks" of the unbelievable ruling. Crowe is particularly successful in placing the murder within its larger historical context, detailing life both in the segregated Jim Crow South and in Emmett's less volatile but still segregated Chicago, and he doesn't shy away from the horrifying details (there's a shocking black-and-white photo of Emmett's disfigured corpse among the illustrations). Crowe's occasional re-creations of events are vivid, but like the rest of the text, they would have been better served with more extensive source notes; only a few in-text references and a concluding bibliography are provided. But Crowe's powerful, terrifying account does justice to its subject in bold, direct telling, supported by numerous archival photos and quotes from those who remember, including Emmett's mother, who wrote on her son's gravestone: "A little nobody who shook up the world." A time line and a list of further resources conclude. <i>Gillian Engberg</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

In his Gospel, we discover how Jesus responded to people like us. Jesus didn&#x2019;t simply redraw the lines and create a wider circle.

In the New Testament&#x2019;s longest book, Luke, the physician friend of the Apostle Paul, reveals Jesus as the Man who came to save all-including women, the poor, the outcast, the sick, and the ordinary, everyday people of every nation. Luke&#x2019;s vivid, fast-moving report offers a gospel of reconciliation and celebration. This Bible study traces Luke&#x2019;s story from the announcement of Jesus&#x2019; birth, through His ministry in Galilee and His training of the disciples on the way to Jerusalem, to His submission to the crucifixion and His ultimate triumph in the resurrection.

As a child growing up in Los Angeles, I used to wish that my huge, congested city were more like the places in the books that I loved - places where forests grew and seasons changed, where animals talked and anything was possible. I envied those characters who slid down rabbit holes, or visited with Charlotte and Wilbur, or flew with Peter Pan, or floated with Mary Poppins, or journeyed to Oz.<p>Since I couldn't actually visit these wonderful worlds (except, of course, by reading), I made little imaginary worlds of my own, using the materials at hand. My favorite project was an enormous dollhouse in my closet. The house was filled both with "store-bought" toys, and with dolls and creatures which I made myself, from paper, cloth and clay. I'd lose myself for hours making up stories about these characters. I loved to make them treasures from scraps of this and that: a paper doily would become a lace tablecloth; half a walnut-shell would be a baby's cozy cradle; a postage stamp would make a lovely portrait on the wall. Around the dollhouse I painted a mural, a fanciful landscape of forests, fields, mountains, blue skies - the world that I wished I could live in.</p><p>I lived in Los Angeles until I was 17, then left to study at U.C. Berkeley where I received a BA in English and later a teaching credential. After reading to young children as a teacher for several years, I had a strong desire to make my own books. My first picture book was published in 1988, and eighteen have followed. (Sometimes I illustrate other authors' stories, sometimes my own.) Like all authors and illustrators, I love to make up characters, and build stories and environments around them. To make my pictures I combine many media: watercolor, gouache, ink, colored pencils, pastels, markers, crayons -- anything that works! I also use lots of collage. As I did in childhood, I snip and glue old scraps into new shapes: a piece of wool becomes a lion's mane or a child's hair. A doily, snipped to bits, becomes a snowstorm.</p><p>Like my collages, my stories are also about the power of imagination to transform old into new, familiar into fantastical. In the book <b>The Lion And The Little Red Bird</b>, a lion turns his tail into a paintbrush, and the walls of his cave into a sunlit, painted world. In <b>The Paper Princess</b>, a drawing on paper becomes full of possibilities: by turns, it is a paper doll, a crumbled wad of litter, a birthday card, and a beloved doll again. The child in <b>Hooray, A Pinata!</b> imagines that a dog pi�ata is a favorite pet. Ernst the crocodile in <b>The Puddle Pail</b> sees ordinary rain puddles as sparkling, collectible treasures . The girl in <b>A Monster In The House</b> imagines her baby brother to be a giant, messy, screaming, toe-sucking, hair-pulling monster. And in my newest book, <b>Sun Bread</b>, a baker brightens a bleak winter by shaping bread dough into a warm, glowing, life-giving sun.</p><p>Although I love creating imaginary worlds, I also enjoy drawing real places. Three of the books I've illustrated take place in big U.S. cities. <b>Abuela</b>, by Arthur Dorros, is set in New York. <b>City By The Bay</b>, by Tricia Brown, is "a magical journey around San Fransisco." And <b>City Of Angels</b>, by Julie Jaskol and Brian Lewis, explores my home city of L.A. The life,energy, textures and wealth of detail in cities inspire my collages.</p><p>I'm very inspired as well by my children, Mia and Ben (ages nine and four), my husband Paul, our two dogs and our cat. They all appear in many forms and disguises in my books! My family and I live in the town of Albany, California, next door to Berkeley and across the bay from San Fransisco. From our window, we can see the Golden Gate Bridge, and the boats on San Fransisco Bay.</p><p>copyright � 2000 by Penguin Putnam Books for Young Readers.

Its story line and artwork both have unusual and unexpected qualities that work together to generate a magical, light mood. A little bird and a lion, friends although they don't understand one another's language, are inexplicably happy when they're together. The bird loves the sight of the lion's tail, which changes color daily. When the lion brings the bird into his cave, she understands the changes; the lion uses his tail as a paint brush for creating beautiful murals. In light of this knowledge, she sings her happiest song for him as their friendship deepens. Kleven's collages incorporate pastels, ink, paper, and wool. Their beautiful colors, surprising textures, and striking details give emotion and meaning to the story. She is especially successful in depicting the lion's gentleness and in suggesting the feelings that bond these two, which provides the power behind the story and fuel for readers' interest. A unique and worthwhile contribution to any collection. --Dorothy Houlihan, formerly at White Plains Public Library, NY<br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Burgm�ller -- 25 Progressive Pieces, Op. 100: Book &amp; CD (Alfred Masterwork CD Edition)</h2><p>Burgm�ller's most famous work, the 25 Progressive Pieces, are short compositions with descriptive titles.

Mr. Rochester lays out an extraordinarily compelling case which documents the enormous financial cost of current and past anti-black discrimination on African American households. The Black Tax, provides the fact pattern, data and evidence to substantiate what African Americans have long experienced and tried to convey to an unbelieving American public. Backed by an exceptional amount of research, Mr. Rochester not only highlights the extraordinary cost of the discrimination that African Americans currently face, but also explores the massive cost of past discrimination to explain why after 400 years Black Americans own only about 2% of American wealth. He then establishes a framework that Black Americans and other concerned parties can use to eliminate this tax and help create the 6 million jobs and 1.4 million businesses that are missing from the Black community. The Black Tax takes the reader through a complete paradigm shift that causes the reader to evaluate all forms of spending and investment in terms of the number of jobs created or businesses developed within the Black community. The Black Tax is immensely informative, thoroughly engaging and makes one of the most compelling and effective cases to commercialize Black businesses since the founding of the Negro Business League in 1910.</p><p></p><h2>Binky the Space Cat (A Binky Adventure)</h2><p>Binky is a space cat - at least in his own mind.

Her lifelong love of Irish mythology led to a close study of Celtic Witchcraft. A natural clairvoyant and empath, she has worked as a tarot card reader and is ordained as a minister with the Universal Life Church.</p><p><strong>Introduction: The Call of the Morrigan</strong></p> <blockquote>The beauty and might of this goddess lie not only in her connection to the cycle of death, but also in her ability to mold her power and gifts to the current situation, to the needs of men and women, to the requirements of the gods.<br> &#x2015;Michelle Skye, <em>Goddess Alive</em></blockquote> <p>The Morrigan flies through the pages of history and myth like an uncontainable whirlwind. Upon ancient battlefields she appeared as a raven, her wild shrieks and battle cry killing men where they stood. She could be a beautiful lusty maiden one minute and a fearsome hag the next. To some she appeared as a phantom, washing the blood-stained clothes of those destined to die along lonely river banks; to others she brought unparalleled victory and protection. The Morrigan is full of mystery, magick, and contradictions. She is powerful and wise but not always benevolent, her nature not always apparent at first glance, her wisdom not easily earned. Is she a tutelary goddess, or a goddess of war? Is she a friend to the Irish hero C�chulain, or his greatest enemy? Is she loving or spiteful? In Irish mythology, the Morrigan refuses to be boxed into just one role. Just when you think you've figured her out, she changes shape and becomes something else (as a shape-shifter, this seems only fitting). Although she is commonly labeled as a goddess of battle, this is an oversimplification of a very dynamic deity. Like many goddesses of the Celtic pantheon, the Morrigan fills multiple roles: she is a goddess of war, of fertility, of sovereignty, and of magick, all at once.</p> <p>It isn't surprising that the Morrigan is perhaps one of the most popular Celtic goddesses in modern Paganism. She exudes an air of confidence, power, and magick. She survives in various incarnations within the Celtic tradition, as a goddess, faery woman, ghostly phantom, and mortal queen. Today she remains a popular protagonist in fiction, such as in Marion Zimmer Bradley's <em>The Mists of Avalon</em> and Pat O'Shea's <em>The Hounds of the Morrigan</em>.</p> <p>Yet despite this, her myths and importance in the Celtic pantheon are often misunderstood. For many, her reputation as a goddess of death and war makes the Morrigan an intimidating figure to work with. Although nineteenth-century scholars interpreted her as a goddess of war, this is not precisely correct. At times she does bring about death, participate in battle, and protect warriors; but she is more accurately called a goddess of sovereignty. She is the patroness of those who wield power, whether it is the power of kingship, prowess on the battlefield, the power over life and death, or personal power.</p> <p>My own experiences with the Morrigan began a few years after my initiation into Witchcraft. At the time, my life had been very chaotic and a goddess personifying victory over life's battles and inner strength was quite appealing. But even when the Morrigan began to make her presence known in my life, I hesitated to call upon her. Never one to be ignored, the Morrigan then began getting my attention in dramatic ways. Crows, one of her totem animals, began taking an unusual interest in my home, my office, and even my car. When I left for work in the morning, there was always at least one crow perched on top of my car; sometimes it seemed like an entire flock! At first I thought they were attracted to the garbage cans we kept near my usual parking spot, but after moving the cans to the other side of the house and even attempting to park my car elsewhere, my mornings continued to begin with the harsh cries of some very curious birds. At work my boss asked me if I was feeding the crows, since there was almost always one perched on the window ledge next to my desk several times a day. Several people "coincidently" (but we know there are no mere coincidences in a magickal life) lent me books that mentioned the Morrigan or Morgan le Fay, or fantasy novels featuring goddesses that bore a strong resemblance to her. I had remarkably vivid dreams where the Morrigan appeared in both human and animal form.</p> <p>I had always had an affinity for Morgan le Fay as a child, and when I began to study Celtic mythology, I found it fascinating that&#x2015;like the goddess Brigid, who survived into Christian times as a saint&#x2015;the Morrigan had "diminished" in importance over the years. But she had not been completely forgotten, transforming into King Arthur's sorceress sister. While I had found her history interesting, most of the books I read warned against invoking the Morrigan; some even advised against any contact with this goddess. This general discouragement of contact with the Morrigan warred with the inexplicable pull I felt toward her. Finally I decided to follow my instincts.</p> <p>On the next new moon, I cast a circle and invoked the Morrigan. That first encounter with the Morrigan was one of the most exhilarating experiences I&#x2019;ve ever had during ritual work. The Morrigan&#x2019;s presence was so tangible, her voice so clear; it was like nothing I had ever felt before. The beauty of Paganism is that we experience our gods, and after that ritual, there could never be any question for me about the presence and reality of the Divine. The Morrigan's presence radiated power and strength, and I couldn't help but wonder why a goddess who represented personal power and overcoming injustice would ever be described as a divinity to be avoided.</p> <p>After my initial experience with the Morrigan, I immediately began searching for more information about this powerful goddess, only to find very little that was useful. The more I searched, the more I began to understand the hesitation some felt toward working with her. Besides finding very little information about her history or worship, almost all the information I found was negative. When I spoke to other Pagans who had felt drawn to the Morrigan, our conversations usually revolved around whether or not it was "safe" to work with a goddess of death and war. Eventually I realized that most of what I would learn about the Morrigan would be from the Morrigan herself. For someone who had learned Witchcraft primarily from books, this was a daunting idea.</p> <p>Now, after more than a decade serving as her Priestess, I can't imagine my life without the strong, reassuring presence of the Morrigan. She has been an invaluable guide, a protector, and a source of strength. The Morrigan stands ready at the edge of our perceptions to challenge our views of the world and of ourselves. She, like the Hindu Kali, is the Terrible Mother, the Dark Goddess, but no less a mother for it. She will not coddle us but will instigate and incite change in ourselves and our lives. The process of change and transformation can be painful, but it is ultimately rewarding.</p> <p>As a goddess of death and war, she is a goddess of hard truths. All living things must one day die in order to sustain new life and be reborn. Sometimes war is necessary to establish peace or retain one&#x2019;s freedom. The Morrigan stands fast next to her children through their battles, guiding them to victory and the peace that is the ultimate goal of any battle. Once she has taught us to battle and conquer our inner demons, she appears as the vibrant goddess of sovereignty, teaching us to embrace the abundance and joy of life.</p> <p>This book is a guide to working with an ancient goddess in the modern world. It contains information about the Morrigan's myths and her role in the Celtic tradition, and also offers pathworking, exercises, spells, rituals, recipes, and magickal correspondences that you can use to invoke the Morrigan's magick and transformative power into your life. In Part One you will find information about the Morrigan's origins and mythology, along with short retellings of her myths and their hidden spiritual meaning. Parts Two and Three cover the different goddesses that form the Morrigan's triple nature and the many guises she embodies, while Part Four offers information about altars, types of offerings, seasonal and lunar rituals, and how to incorporate the Morrigan into a modern-day spiritual system. I suggest you read the background information in Part I first in order to become familiar with her myths. The other sections do not necessarily need to be read in order, so feel free to begin with whichever of the Morrigan's aspects or guises you feel drawn to work with.</p> <p>The Great Goddess resides within each of us, her wisdom just as vital to the modern seeker as it was to the ancient Celts who worshipped her. The very first step to answering the call of the Morrigan is to open ourselves to her presence and wisdom. So whether you feel drawn to her as I was or you simply want to know more about this goddess, I invite you to invoke the Morrigan and draw upon the strength and wisdom of this truly powerful goddess!</p></p><h2>The Prism of Lyra: An Exploration of Human Galactic Heritage</h2><p><b><i>The Prism of Lyra</i> is an exploration of Human Galactic Heritage.</b> <p> <i>The Prism of Lyra</i> is a book that examines the idea of creation in a different light.

Printz Award, a 2006 National Book Award Finalist for Young People's Literature, the winner of the 2007 Eisner Award for Best Graphic Album: New, an Eisner Award nominee for Best Coloring, a 2007 Bank Street Best Children's Book of the Year, and a <i>New York Times</i> bestseller.</p><p>This title has Common Core Connections</p></p><p>Indie graphic novelist Gene Yang's intelligent and emotionally challenging <i>American Born Chinese</i> is made up of three individual plotlines: the determined efforts of the Chinese folk hero Monkey King to shed his humble roots and be revered as a god; the struggles faced by Jin Wang, a lonely Asian American middle school student who would do anything to fit in with his white classmates; and the sitcom plight of Danny, an All-American teen so shamed by his Chinese cousin Chin-Kee (a purposefully painful ethnic stereotype) that he is forced to change schools. Each story works well on its own, but Yang engineers a clever convergence of these parallel tales into a powerful climax that destroys the hateful stereotype of Chin-Kee, while leaving both Jin Wang and the Monkey King satisfied and happy to be who they are.<p> Yang skillfully weaves these affecting, often humorous stories together to create a masterful commentary about race, identity, and self-acceptance that has earned him a spot as a finalist for the National Book Award for Young People. The artwork, rendered in a chromatically cool palette, is crisp and clear, with clean white space around center panels that sharply focuses the reader's attention in on Yang's achingly familiar characters. There isn't an adolescent alive who won't be able to relate to Jin's wish to be someone other than who he is, and his gradual realization that there is no better feeling than being comfortable in your own skin.<i>--Jennifer Hubert</i></p>I started&nbsp;<i>American Born Chinese</i> about five years into my comics career. (Though at the time, it was really more of a vocation since I wasn't making any money at it.) Up 'til then, I'd done a couple of stories with Asian-American protagonists, but I never dealt with the Asian-American experience head-on. Since my own ethnic heritage is such an important part of how I understand myself, I knew I wanted to. I came up with three ideas and couldn't decide which one was the best.&nbsp;<i>American Born Chinese</i> is me doing all three at once.</p><h2>Ventures Basic Student&#39;s Book</h2><p>Ventures 3rd Edition Basic Student&#39;s Book has 10 units with six lessons each, based on relevant adult-learner themes.

Detective Mike Bennett, recently widowed, is depicted as a hard-driving man who is able to balance pressure from his commissioner, the mayor, and the media with overseeing 10 adopted children.

Growing up, half the time I �didn&#x2019;t have a clue what his jokes were about, but I laughed anyways. Down at the barbershop, it �didn&#x2019;t matter how many guys my father let take cuts ahead of him in line, he just wanted to sit there all Saturday and crack people up. Make folks bust a gut. Getting his hair cut was definitely a low priority.<br><br>He says, &#x201c;Stop me if you&#x2019;ve heard this one before . . .&#x201d; The way my old man tells it, he walks into the oncologist&#x2019;s office and he says, &#x201c;After the chemotherapy, will I be able to play the violin?&#x201d;<br><br>In response, the oncologist says, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s metastasized. You&#x2019;ve got six months to live . . .&#x201d;<br><br>And working his eyebrows like Groucho Marx, tapping the ash from an invisible cigar, my old man says, &#x201c;Six months?&#x201d; He says, &#x201c;I want a second opinion.&#x201d;<br><br>So the oncologist, he says, &#x201c;Okay, you&#x2019;ve got cancer and your jokes stink.&#x201d;<br><br>So they do chemotherapy, and they give him some radiation like they do even if the shit burns him up so bad on the inside he tells me that taking a piss is like passing razor blades. He&#x2019;s still every Saturday down by the barbershop telling jokes even if now he&#x2019;s bald as a cue ball. I mean, he&#x2019;s skinny as a bald skeleton, and he&#x2019;s getting to haul around one of those cylinders of oxygen under pressure, like some little version of a �ball-�and-�chain. He walks into the barbershop dragging that pressurized cylinder of oxygen with the tube of it going up and looping around his nose, over his ears, and around his bald head, and he says, &#x201c;Just a little off the top, please.&#x201d; And folks laugh. Understand me: My old man is no Uncle Milty. He&#x2019;s no Edgar Bergen. The man&#x2019;s skinny as a Halloween skeleton and bald and going to be dead by six weeks so it don&#x2019;t matter what he says, folks are going to �hee-�haw like donkeys just out of their genuine affection for him.<br><br>But, seriously, I&#x2019;m not doing him justice. It&#x2019;s my fault if this �doesn&#x2019;t come across, but my old man is funnier than he sounds. Maybe his sense of humor is a talent I �didn&#x2019;t inherit. Back when I was his little Charlie McCarthy, the whole time growing up, he used to ask me, �&#x201c;Knock-�knock?&#x201d;<br><br>I&#x2019;d say, &#x201c;Who&#x2019;s there?&#x201d;<br><br>He&#x2019;d say, &#x201c;Old Lady . . .&#x201d;<br><br>I&#x2019;d say, &#x201c;Old Lady, who?&#x201d;<br><br>And he&#x2019;d say, &#x201c;Wow, I �didn&#x2019;t know you could yodel!&#x201d;<br><br>Me, I �didn&#x2019;t get it. I was so stupid, I was seven years old and still stuck in the first grade. I �didn&#x2019;t know Switzerland from Shinola, but I want for my old man to love me so I learned to laugh. Whatever he says, I laugh. By &#x201c;Old Lady&#x201d; my guess is he means my mom who ran away and left us. All&#x2019;s my old man will say about her is how she was a &#x201c;Real Looker&#x201d; who just �couldn&#x2019;t take a joke. She just was NOT a Good Sport.<br><br>He used to ask me, &#x201c;When that Vinnie van Gogh cut off his ear and sent it to the whore he was so crazy about, how&#x2019;d he send it?&#x201d;<br><br>The punch line is &#x201c;He sent it by &#x2018;ear mail,&#x2019; &#x201d; but being seven years old, I was still stuck back on not knowing who van Gogh is or �what&#x2019;s a whore, and nothing kills a joke faster than asking my old man to explain himself. So when my old man says, &#x201c;What do you get when you cross a pig with Count Dracula?&#x201d; . . . I knew to never ask, &#x201c;What&#x2019;s a &#x2018;Count Dracula&#x2019;?&#x201d; I&#x2019;d just get a big laugh ready for when he tells me, &#x201c;A �&#x2018;Ham-�pire&#x2019;!&#x201d;<br><br>And when he says, �&#x201c;Knock-�knock . . .&#x201d;<br><br>And I say, &#x201c;Who&#x2019;s there?&#x201d; And he says, &#x201c;Radio.&#x201d;<br><br>And I say, &#x201c;Radio who?&#x201d; And he&#x2019;s ALREADY started to bust a gut when he says, &#x201c;Radio not I&#x2019;m going to cum in your mouth . . .&#x201d; �Then&#x2014;�what the �hell&#x2014;�I just keep laughing. My whole growing up I figure I&#x2019;m just too ignorant to appreciate a good joke. Me, my teachers still �haven&#x2019;t covered long division and all the �multiple-�cation tables so it&#x2019;s not my old man&#x2019;s fault I don&#x2019;t know �what&#x2019;s &#x201c;cum.&#x201d;<br><br>My old lady, who abandoned us, he says she hated that joke so maybe I inherited her lack of humor. But love . . . I mean you have to love your old man. I mean, after you&#x2019;re born it&#x2019;s not like you get a choice. Nobody wants to see their old man breathing out of some tank and going into the hospital to die �sky-�high on morphine and he&#x2019;s not eating a bite of the �red-�flavored �Jell-�O they serve for dinner.<br><br>Stop me if I already told you this one: but my old man gets that prostrate cancer �that&#x2019;s not even like cancer because it takes twenty, thirty years before we even know he&#x2019;s so sick, and the next thing I know is I&#x2019;m trying to remember all the stuff he&#x2019;s taught me. Like, if you spray some �WD-�40 on the shovel blade before you dig a hole the digging will go a lot easier. And he taught me how to squeeze a trigger instead of pulling it and wrecking my aim. He taught me to remove bloodstains. And he taught me jokes . . . lots of jokes.<br><br>And, sure, he&#x2019;s no Robin Williams, but I watched this movie one time about Robin Williams who gets dressed up with a red rubber ball on his nose and this big �rainbow-�colored afro wig and those big clown shoes with a fake carnation stuck in his buttonhole of his shirt that squirts water, and the guy&#x2019;s a hotshot doctor who makes these little kids with cancer laugh so hard they stop dying. Understand me: These bald kid �skeletons&#x2014;�who look worse off than my old �man&#x2014;�they get HEALTHY, and that whole movie is based on a True Story.<br><br>What I mean is, we all know that Laughter is the Best Medicine. All that time being stuck in the hospital Waiting Room, even I read the �Reader&#x2019;s Digest. And we&#x2019;ve all heard the true story about the guy with a brain cancer the size of a grapefruit inside his skull and he&#x2019;s about to �croak&#x2014;�all the doctors and priests and experts say he&#x2019;s a �goner&#x2014;�only he forces himself to watch nonstop movies about the Three Stooges. This Stage Four cancer guy forces himself to laugh nonstop at Abbott and Costello and Laurel and Hardy and those Marx brothers, and he gets healed by the �end-�orphans and �oxy-�generated blood.<br><br>So I figure, what&#x2019;ve I got to lose? All I need to do is remember some of my old man&#x2019;s favorite gags and get him started back laughing on the road to recovery. I figure, what could it hurt?<br><br>So this �grown-up son walks into his father&#x2019;s hospice room, pulls up a chair beside the bed, and sits down. The son looks into his old man&#x2019;s pale, dying face and says: &#x201c;So this blond gal walks into a neighborhood bar where she&#x2019;s never been before, and she&#x2019;s got tits out to HERE and a tight little heinie and she asks the bartender for a Michelob, and he serves her a Michelob, except he sneaks a Mickey Finn into her bottle and this blonde goes unconscious, and every guy in the bar leans her over the edge of the pool table and hikes up her skirt and fucks her, and at closing time they slap her awake and tell her she&#x2019;s got to leave. And every few days this gal with the tits and the ass walks in and asks for a Michelob and gets a Mickey Finn and gets fucked by the crowd until one day she walks in and asks the bartender, can he maybe give her a Budweiser instead?&#x201d;<br><br>Granted&#x2014;�I have NOT landed this particular �shaggy-�dog story since I was in the first grade, but my old man used to love this next part . . .<br><br>The bartender smiles so nice and says, &#x201c;What? You don&#x2019;t like Michelob no more?&#x201d;<br><br>And this Real Looker, she leans over the bar, all confidential and she whispers, &#x201c;Just between you and me . . .&#x201d; she whispers, &#x201c;Michelob makes my pussy hurt . . .&#x201d;<br><br>The first time I learned that joke, when my old man taught it to me, I �didn&#x2019;t know what was &#x201c;pussy.&#x201d; I �didn&#x2019;t know &#x201c;Mickey Finn.&#x201d; I �didn&#x2019;t know what folks meant when they talked about &#x201c;fucking,&#x201d; but I knew all this talk made my old man laugh. And when he told me to stand up and tell that joke in the barbershop it made the barbers and every old man reading detective magazines laugh until half of them blew spit and snot and chewing tobacco out their noses.<br><br>Now the �grown-up son tells his old dying father this joke, just the two of them alone in that hospital room, �late-�late at night, �and&#x2014;�guess �what&#x2014;�his old man �doesn&#x2019;t laugh. So the son tries another old favorite, he tells the joke about the Traveling Salesman who gets a phone call from some Farmer&#x2019;s Daughter he met on the road a couple months before, and she says, &#x201c;Remember me? We had some laughs, and I was a good sport?&#x201d; and the man says, &#x201c;How&#x2019;re you doing?&#x201d; and she says, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m pregnant, and I&#x2019;m going to kill myself.&#x201d; And the salesman, he says, &#x201c;Damn . . . you ARE a good sport!&#x201d;<br><br>At seven years old I could �REALLY put that joke �over&#x2014;�but, tonight the old man&#x2019;s still not laughing. How I learned to say &#x201c;I Love You&#x201d; was by laughing for my old �man&#x2014;�even if I had to fake �it&#x2014;�and �that&#x2019;s all I want in return. All I want from him is a laugh, just one laugh, and he&#x2019;s not coming across with even a giggle. Not a snicker. Not even a groan. And worse than �not-�laughing, the old man squints his eyes shut, tight, and opens them brimming with tears, and one fat tear floods out the bottom of each eye and washes down each cheek. The old man&#x2019;s gasping his big toothless mouth like he can&#x2019;t get enough air, crying big tears down the wrinkles of both cheeks, just soaking his pillow. So this �kid&#x2014;�who&#x2019;s nobody&#x2019;s little kid, not �anymore&#x2014;�but who can&#x2019;t seem to forget these jokes, he reaches into his pants pocket and gets out a fake carnation flower that �just-�for-�laughs sprays water all over the old crybaby&#x2019;s face.<br><br>The kid tells about the Polack who&#x2019;s carrying a rifle through the woods when he comes across a naked gal laying back on a bed of soft green moss with her legs spread, and this gal is a Real Looker, and she looks at the Polack and his gun and says, &#x201c;What&#x2019;re you doing?&#x201d; And the Polack says, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m hunting for game.&#x201d; And this Real Looker, she gives him a big wink and she says, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m game.&#x201d;<br><br>So&#x2014;�POW!&#x2014;�the Polack shoots her. It used to be this joke constituted a �gold-�plated, bona fide, �sure-�thing laugh riot, but the old man just keeps dying. He&#x2019;s still crying and not even making an effort to laugh, and no matter what, the old man has got to meet me halfway. I can&#x2019;t save him if he �doesn&#x2019;t want to live. I ask him, &#x201c;What do you get when you cross a faggot with a kike?&#x201d; I ask him, &#x201c;What&#x2019;s the difference between dog shit and a nigger?&#x201d;<br><br>And he&#x2019;s still not getting any better. I&#x2019;m thinking maybe the cancer&#x2019;s got into his ears. With the morphine and what all, it could be he can&#x2019;t hear me. So just to test, can he hear me, I lean into his crybaby face and I ask, &#x201c;How do you get a nun pregnant?&#x201d; Then, more loud, maybe too loud for this being a �mackerel-�snapper hospital, I yell, &#x201c;You FUCK her!&#x201d;<br><br>In my desperation I try fag jokes and wetback jokes and kike �jokes&#x2014;�really, every effective course of treatment known to medical �science&#x2014;�and the old man&#x2019;s still slipping away. Lying here, in this bed, is the man who made EVERYTHING into a Big Joke. Just the fact he&#x2019;s not biting scares the shit out of me. I&#x2019;m yelling, �&#x201c;Knock-�knock!&#x201d; and when he says nothing in response it&#x2019;s the same as him not having a pulse. I&#x2019;m yelling, �&#x201c;Knock-�knock!&#x201d;<br><br>I&#x2019;m yelling, &#x201c;Why did the Existentialist cross the road?&#x201d;<br><br>And he&#x2019;s STILL dying, the old man&#x2019;s leaving me not knowing the answer to anything. He&#x2019;s abandoning me while I&#x2019;m still so fucking stupid. In my desperation I reach out to take the limp, blue fingers of his �cold-�cold dying hand and he �doesn&#x2019;t flinch even when I grind a Joy Buzzer against the blue skin of his �ice-�cold palm. I&#x2019;m yelling, �&#x201c;Knock-�knock?&#x201d;<br><br>I&#x2019;m yelling, &#x201c;Why&#x2019;d the Old Lady walk out on her husband and her �four-�year-�old kid?&#x201d;<br><br>Nothing kills a joke like asking my old man to explain himself, and lying there in that bed, he stops breathing. No heartbeat. Totally flatlined.<br><br>So this kid who&#x2019;s sitting bedside in this hospital room, �late-�late at night he takes the joke equivalent of those electric paddles doctors use to stop your heart attack, the �hee-�haw equivalent of what a paramedic Robin Williams would use on you in some Clown Emergency �Room&#x2014;�a kind of Three Stooges �defibrillator&#x2014;�the kid takes a big, creamy, �heaped-up custard pie topped with a �thick-�thick layer of whipped cream, the same as Charlie Chaplin would save your life with, and the kid reaches that pie up �sky-�high overhead, as high as the kid can reach, and brings it down, hard, �lightning-�fast, �slam-�dunking it hard as the blast from a Polack&#x2019;s �shotgun&#x2014;�POW!&#x2014;�right in his old man&#x2019;s kisser.<br><br>And despite the miraculous, �well-�documented healing powers of the Comedic Arts my old man dies taking a big bloody shit in his bed.<br><br>No, �really, it&#x2019;s funnier than it sounds. Please, don&#x2019;t blame my old man. If you&#x2019;re not laughing at this point, it&#x2019;s my fault. I just �didn&#x2019;t tell it right, you know, you mess up a punch line and you can totally botch even the best joke. For example, I went back to the barbershop and told them how he died and how I tried to save him, right up to and including the custard pie and how the hospital had their security goons escort me up to the crazy ward for a little �seventy-�two-�hour observation. And even telling that part, I fucked it �up&#x2014;�because those barbershop guys just looked at me. I told them about �seeing&#x2014;�and �smelling&#x2014;�my old man, dead and smeared all over with blood and shit and whipped cream, all that stink and sugar, and they looked and looked at me, the barbers and the old guys chewing tobacco, and nobody laughed. Standing in that same barbershop all these years later, I say, �&#x201c;Knock-�knock.&#x201d;</p><h2>Psychogenic Non-epileptic Seizures: A Guide</h2><p>You&#x2019;ve just been told that those seizures you&#x2019;ve been having for months or years and that have been making a mess of your life aren&#x2019;t actually due to epilepsy and that instead they are caused by psychological stress.

Jane Dyer, illustrator of the bestselling <i>Time for Bed</i>, creates positively touchable watercolors of a pudgy-cheeked preschooler bird and his working mom. Hints of hearts nestle playfully on the pages: on the blackboard under the letter H, and sewn onto his pillowcase. <i>Oh My Baby, Little One</i> will resonate deeply for moms and kids alike, and may make daily separations just a little bit easier. <blockquote> So blow a kiss and wave good-bye--<br> my baby, don't you cry. <br> This love is always with you, <br> like the sun is with the sky. <br> </blockquote> (Ages 3 to 6) <i>--Emilie Coulter</i>Hardcover edition 2000<br>0-15-200041-0&nbsp;<br>Previous paperback edition 2005<br>0-15-205242-9 pb<br></p><h2>Reciprocal Teaching at Work: Powerful Strategies and Lessons for Improving Reading Comprehension</h2><p><p><b>Foreword by John Hattie</b></p><p>In this fully revised and expanded third edition of the bestselling <em>Reciprocal Teaching at Work</em>, Lori D.

Written in a style that is clear and direct, this book will serve as an invaluable asset to educators who seek to make a difference in their schools, and in the lives of the children they serve. (Pedro Noguera Ph.D, Distinguished Professor of Education, faculty director, Center for the Transformation of Schools, UCLA Graduate School of Education &amp; Information Studies)<br><br>I believe that all educators come to their work to make a difference for the children who need us the most.

His books have sold well over a million copies and his most recent edition of &#x201c;Marijuana Grower&#x2019;s Handbook&#x201d; has revolutionized the field. Ed is also on the faculty of Oaksterdam University, the leading trade school for the cannabis industry. His classes teach pupils how different techniques can be used to improve the yield and efficiency of their gardens. <br><br> Ed has always been driven by a desire to develop innovative, effective, and non-toxic methods of gardening. He was one of the original American writers to travel to Holland, bringing the knowledge and sophistication of European horticulture to the U.S. through his books and Ask Ed column. While his career has focused on marijuana cultivation, he is an avid gardener of edible plants and flowers as well. Ultimately, Ed believes that no matter the plant, a gardener should never be forced to resort to using potentially dangerous means in order to enjoy a bountiful harvest. <br><br> Beyond the garden, Ed views marijuana law as a crucial social issue and has been active in promoting and developing policies of civil regulation. In 2003 he was tried in Federal Court for cultivation in a trial where the jury was not allowed to hear that he was deputized by the City of Oakland to provide marijuana for patients. His trial shifted public opinion in favor of state medical marijuana laws. <br><br> His best-selling titles include; The Big Book of Buds series, Marijuana Garden Saver, Best of Ask Ed, and Marijuana Grower's Handbook, among others.Here's what people are saying about the first edition of Beyond Buds: <br><br> "The world of cannabis concentrates is expanding, and if you have any interest in exploring this new frontier, we've got a reading recommendation for you....

In each story, I incorporated familiar things from their lives and bent reality to take them on journeys into unforeseen worlds. They were always the main characters. At the story's climax, I would announce that I'd finish the story the following night. If that generated clamors of protest, I knew I was on the right track. Bedtime stories evolved into writing my first book <i>Code 7: Cracking the Code for an Epic Life</i>, which is also available as a bilingual Spanish-English edition <i>C�digo 7: Descifrando el c�digo para una vida �pica</i>. The enthusiasm from fans gave me great satisfaction, and I had to do just one more:<i> The Proto Project</i>.&nbsp;<br><br>Thank you for joining me on an adventure of the mind! I hope you enjoy reading <i>The Proto Project</i> as much as I enjoyed writing it, and once you have finished the book, I also hope you will know that the future is yours to write, too.<br>Sincerely,<b>Bryan R.

Yet it has remained a classic for 140 years. Now the beloved story of Black Beauty is retold for beginning readers with full-color illustrations on every page.</p><p>"A horse is a horse of course unless of course the horse is Black Beauty. Animal-loving children have been devoted to Black Beauty throughout this century, and no doubt will continue through the next. Although Anna Sewell's classic paints a clear picture of turn-of-the-century London, its message is universal and timeless: animals will serve humans well if they are treated with consideration and kindness.<p>Black Beauty tells the story of the horse's own long and varied life, from a well-born colt in a pleasant meadow to an elegant carriage horse for a gentleman to a painfully overworked cab horse. Throughout, Sewell rails--in a gentle, 19th-century way--against animal maltreatment. Young readers will follow Black Beauty's fortunes, good and bad, with gentle masters as well as cruel. Children can easily make the leap from horse-human relationships to human-human relationships, and begin to understand how their own consideration of others may be a benefit to all. (Ages 9 to 12)"</p>Black Beauty's tale, as told by himself, is the fascinating story of the life of a horse a hundred years ago, when horseswere a part of everyone's life.<p></p><p>Although his colthood and early life were happy, Black Beauty tastes the bitterness of cruel grooms and indifferent masters as he passes from hand to hand, progressing from the country to London and back again.</p><p></p><p>This, the most famous horse story ever written, is a must on everyone's reading list.</p></p><h2>First 50 Jazz Standards You Should Play on Guitar</h2><p>(Guitar Collection).

The Prisoners' Self-Help Litigation Manual, available for more than 25 years but recently updated, takes on the task of providing prisoners with the tools to handle their legal needs. It explains the pertinent law, shows them what they need to do to litigate an issue, and provides them with resources for help.

Murray Scheinberg&#x2019;s memoir of survival through the Nazi Holocaust symbolizes man&#x2019;s determination to live no matter the odds. But it also represents the degradation of the human spirit imposed on the Jews of Europe by the evil Nazi machine.

Emmet Fox (1886-1951) was born in Ireland, and is a famous New Thought spiritual leader of the early 20th Century. He had a large influence on the founding of Alcoholics Anonymous. His writing, especially &#34;The Sermon on the Mount,&#34; became popular in AA. Fox taught that the foundation for all true productive expression was positive thinking. The technique involved having conscious awareness of our daily thought process and connectivity to God in order to realize any change or manifestation in the external environment. This concept was also taught by many mystics, including Rumi, Jesus, Buddha, Gandhi, and others from across all wisdom traditions. Fox believed that the doctrine of the mental equivalent was an essential metaphysical teaching; the doctrine that you will receive that for which you provide the mental equivalent.</p><p>Emmet Fox (1886-1951) was one of the most influential spiritual leaders of the twentieth century and a pioneer of the New Thought movement. His bold, dynamic message proclaiming that our thoughts shape our reality has changed the lives of millions across the world and influenced many key contemporary spiritual writers such as Wayne Dyer, Esther Hicks, and Louise Hay, all of whom have tapped into the power of positive thinking.

As teachers promote collaboration, problem-solving, and communication throughout their learner-driven classrooms, Math Workshop helps them take their instructional practice to the next level. <b>&#x2014;Sarah Putnam, Director of Teaching and Learning, Arlington Public Schools, Arlington, Virginia</b><br><br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Gluten Is My Bitch: Rants, Recipes, and Ridiculousness for the Gluten-Free</h2><p>Living gluten-free is not a whole lot of fun, but at least April has managed to make it funny. <i>Gluten Is My Bitch</i> is a brutally honest, entertaining look at what living a gluten-free life entails. As an antidote to the tragic news that, no, you will never eat regular donuts again, April provides 40 gluten-free comfort food recipes and a bonus 20 new recipes in the paperback edition that will make even the most frustrated gluten-intolerant smile with relief. In the new paperback, April addresses the challenges of sustaining a gluten-free lifestyle once you&#x2019;ve transitioned from the gluten-filled world.

He supposed he wasn&#x2019;t entirely undeserving of her scorn, but he wasn&#x2019;t entirely blind, either. And as the dregs of sunset faded to bitter orange over the Wind River Range, David looked around the station and saw that Willa was gone. He told himself he wasn&#x2019;t sure, but that was only his head&#x2014;his sinking stomach was sure enough.<br> <br>He went to find Lander, who liked her a bit. Who called her spunky when Willa said Amtrak was full of shit for leaving them stranded like this. A lot of them didn&#x2019;t care for her at all, stranded by Amtrak or not.<br> <br>&#x201c;It smells like wet crackers in here!&#x201d; Helen Palmer shouted at him as David walked past. She had found her way to the bench in the corner, as she always did, eventually. The Rhinehart woman was minding her for the time being, giving the husband a little break, and she gave David a smile.<br> <br>&#x201c;Have you seen Willa?&#x201d; David asked.<br> <br>The Rhinehart woman shook her head, still smiling.<br> <br>&#x201c;We got fish for supper!&#x201d; Mrs. Palmer burst out furiously. A knuckle of blue veins beat in the hollow of her temple. A few people looked around. &#x201c;First one t&#x2019;ing an&#x2019; den anudder!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Hush, Helen,&#x201d; the Rhinehart woman said. Maybe her first name was Sally, but David thought he would have remembered a name like that; there were so few Sallys these days. Now the world belonged to the Ambers, Ashleys, and Tiffanys. Willa was another endangered species, and just thinking that made his stomach sink down again.<br> <br>&#x201c;Like crackers!&#x201d; Helen spat. &#x201c;Them dirty old crackers up to camp!&#x201d;<br> <br>Henry Lander was sitting on a bench under the clock. He had his arm around his wife. He glanced up and shook his head before David could ask. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s not here. Sorry. Gone into town if you&#x2019;re lucky. Bugged out for good if you&#x2019;re not.&#x201d; And he made a hitchhiking gesture.<br> <br>David didn&#x2019;t believe his fianc�e would hitchhike west on her own&#x2014;the idea was crazy&#x2014;but he believed she wasn&#x2019;t here. Had known even before counting heads, actually, and a snatch of some old book or poem about winter occurred to him: A cry of absence, absence in the heart.<br> <br>The station was a narrow wooden throat. Down its length, people either strolled aimlessly or simply sat on benches under the fluorescent lights. The shoulders of the ones who sat had that special slump you saw only in places like this, where people waited for whatever had gone wrong to be made right so the broken journey could be mended. Few people came to places like Crowheart Springs, Wyoming on purpose.<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you go haring after her, David,&#x201d; Ruth Lander said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s getting dark, and there&#x2019;s plenty of critters out there. Not just coyotes, either. That book salesman with the limp says he saw a couple of wolves on the other side of the tracks, where the freight depot is.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Biggers,&#x201d; Henry said. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s his name.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t care if his name is Jack D. Ripper,&#x201d; Ruth said. &#x201c;The point is, you&#x2019;re not in Kansas anymore, David.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But if she went&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;She went while it was still daylight,&#x201d; Henry Lander said, as if daylight would stop a wolf (or a bear) from attacking a woman on her own. For all David knew, it might. He was an investment banker, not a wildlife expert. A young investment banker, at that.<br> <br>&#x201c;If the pick-up train comes and she&#x2019;s gone, she&#x2019;ll miss it.&#x201d; He couldn&#x2019;t seem to get this simple fact into their heads. It wasn&#x2019;t getting traction, in the current lingo of his office back in Chicago.<br> <br>Henry raised his eyebrows. &#x201c;Are you telling me that both of you missing it will improve things somehow?&#x201d;<br> <br>If they both missed it, they&#x2019;d either catch a bus or wait for the next train together. Surely Henry and Ruth Lander saw that. Or maybe not. What David mostly saw when he looked at them&#x2014;what was right in front of his eyes&#x2014;was that special weariness reserved for people temporarily stuck in West Overalls. And who else cared for Willa? If she dropped out of sight in the High Plains, who besides David Sanderson would spare a thought? There was even some active dislike for her. That bitch Ursula Davis had told him once that if Willa&#x2019;s mother had left the a off the end of her name, &#x201c;it would have been just about perfect.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to town and look for her,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>Henry sighed. &#x201c;Son, that&#x2019;s very foolish.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We can&#x2019;t be married in San Francisco if she gets left behind in Crowheart Springs,&#x201d; he said, trying to make a joke of it.<br> <br>Dudley was walking by. David didn&#x2019;t know if Dudley was the man&#x2019;s first or last name, only that he was an executive with Staples office supply and had been on his way to Missoula for some sort of regional meeting. He was ordinarily very quiet, so the donkey heehaw of laughter he expelled into the growing shadows was beyond surprising; it was shocking. &#x201c;If the train comes and you miss it,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;you can hunt up a justice of the peace and get married right here. When you get back east, tell all your friends you had a real Western shotgun wedding. Yeehaw, partner.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t do this,&#x201d; Henry said. &#x201c;We won&#x2019;t be here much longer.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;So I should leave her? That&#x2019;s nuts.&#x201d;<br> <br>He walked on before Lander or his wife could reply. Georgia Andreeson was sitting on a nearby bench and watching her daughter caper up and down the dirty tile floor in her red traveling dress. Pammy Andreeson never seemed to get tired. David tried to remember if he had seen her asleep since the train derailed at the Wind River junction point and they had wound up here like someone&#x2019;s forgotten package in the dead letter office. Once, maybe, with her head in her mother&#x2019;s lap. But that might be a false memory, created out of his belief that five-year-olds were supposed to sleep a lot.<br> <br>Pammy hopped from tile to tile, a prank in motion, seeming to use the squares as a giant hopscotch board. Her red dress jumped around her plump knees. &#x201c;I knew a man, his name was Danny,&#x201d; she chanted in a monotonous one-note holler. It made David&#x2019;s fillings ache. &#x201c;He tripped and fell, on his fanny. I knew a man, his name was David. He tripped and fell, on his bavid.&#x201d; She giggled and pointed at David.<br> <br>&#x201c;Pammy, stop,&#x201d; Georgia Andreeson said. She smiled at David and brushed her hair from the side of her face. He thought the gesture unutterably weary, and thought she had a long road ahead with the high-spirited Pammy, especially with no Mr. Andreeson in evidence.<br> <br>&#x201c;Did you see Willa?&#x201d; he asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Gone,&#x201d; she said, and pointed to the door with the sign over it reading TO SHUTTLE, TO TAXIS, CALL AHEAD FROM COURTESY PHONE FOR HOTEL VACANCIES.<br> <br>Here was Biggers, limping toward him. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d avoid the great outdoors, unless armed with a high-powered rifle. There are wolves. I&#x2019;ve seen them.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I knew a girl, her name was Willa,&#x201d; Pammy chanted. &#x201c;She had a headache, and took a pilla.&#x201d; She collapsed to the floor, shouting with laughter.<br> <br>Biggers, the salesman, hadn&#x2019;t waited for a reply. He was limping back down the length of the station. His shadow grew long, shortened in the glow of the hanging fluorescents, then grew long again.<br> <br>Phil Palmer was leaning in the doorway beneath the sign about the shuttle and the taxis. He was a retired insurance man. He and his wife were on their way to Portland. The plan was to stay with their oldest son and his wife for a while, but Palmer had confided to David and Willa that Helen would probably never be coming back east. She had cancer as well as Alzheimer&#x2019;s. Willa called it a twofer. When David told her that was a little cruel, Willa had looked at him, started to say something, and then had only shaken her head.<br> <br>Now Palmer asked, as he always did: &#x201c;Hey, mutt&#x2014;got a butt?&#x201d;<br> <br>To which David answered, as he always did: &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t smoke, Mr. Palmer.&#x201d;<br> <br>And Palmer finished: &#x201c;Just testing you, kiddo.&#x201d;<br> <br>As David stepped out onto the concrete platform where detraining passengers waited for the shuttle to Crowheart Springs, Palmer frowned. &#x201c;Not a good idea, my young friend.&#x201d;<br> <br>Something&#x2014;it might have been a large dog but probably wasn&#x2019;t&#x2014;lifted a howl from the other side of the railway station, where the sage and broom grew almost up to the tracks. A second voice joined it, creating harmony. They trailed off together.<br> <br>&#x201c;See what I mean, jellybean?&#x201d; And Palmer smiled as if he&#x2019;d conjured those howls just to prove his point.<br> <br>David turned, his light jacket rippling around him in the keen breeze, and started down the steps. He went fast, before he could change his mind, and only the first step was really hard. After that he just thought about Willa.<br> <br>&#x201c;David,&#x201d; Palmer said, not joshing now, not joking around. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Why not? She did. Besides, the wolves are over there.&#x201d; He jerked a thumb back over his shoulder. &#x201c;If that&#x2019;s what they are.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Course that&#x2019;s what they are. And no, they probably won&#x2019;t come at you&#x2014;I doubt if they&#x2019;re specially hungry this time of year. But there&#x2019;s no need for both of you to spend another God-knows-how-long in the middle of nowhere just because she got to missing the bright lights.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t seem to understand&#x2014;she&#x2019;s my girl.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to tell you a hard truth, my friend: If she really considered herself your girl, she wouldn&#x2019;t have done what she did. You think?&#x201d;<br> <br>At first David said nothing, because he wasn&#x2019;t sure what he thought. Possibly because he often didn&#x2019;t see what was right in front of his eyes. Willa had said so. Finally he turned back to look at Phil Palmer leaning in the doorway above him. &#x201c;I think you don&#x2019;t leave your fianc�e stranded in the middle of nowhere. That&#x2019;s what I think.&#x201d;<br> <br>Palmer sighed. &#x201c;I almost hope one of those trash-pine lobos does decide to put the bite on your city ass. It might smarten you up. Little Willa Stuart cares for nobody but herself, and everyone sees it but you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;If I pass a Nite Owl store or a 7-Eleven, you want me to pick you up a pack of cigarettes?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Why the fuck not?&#x201d; Palmer said. Then, just as David was walking across NO PARKING TAXI ZONE painted on the empty curbless street: &#x201c;David!&#x201d;<br> <br>David turned back.<br> <br>&#x201c;The shuttle won&#x2019;t be back until tomorrow, and it&#x2019;s three miles to town. Says so, right on the back wall of the information booth. That&#x2019;s six miles, round-trip. On foot. Take you two hours, and that&#x2019;s not counting the time it might take you to track her down.&#x201d;<br> <br>David raised his hand to indicate he heard, but kept going. The wind was off the mountains, and cold, but he liked the way it rippled his clothes and combed back his hair. At first he watched for wolves, scanning one side of the road and then the other, but when he saw none, his thoughts returned to Willa. And really, his mind had been fixed on little else since the second or third time he had been with her.<br> <br>She&#x2019;d gotten to missing the bright lights; Palmer was almost certainly right about that much, but David didn&#x2019;t believe she cared for nobody but herself. The truth was she&#x2019;d just gotten tired of waiting around with a bunch of sad old sacks moaning about how they were going to be late for this, that, and the other. The town over yonder probably didn&#x2019;t amount to much, but in her mind it must have held some possibility for fun, and that had outweighed the possibility of Amtrak sending a special to pick them up while she was gone.<br> <br>And where, exactly, would she have gone looking for fun?<br> <br>He was sure there were no what you&#x2019;d call nightclubs in Crowheart Springs, where the passenger station was just a long green shed with WYOMING and &#x201c;THE EQUALITY STATE&#x201d; painted on the side in red, white, and blue. No nightclubs, no discos, but there were undoubtedly bars, and he thought she&#x2019;d settle for one of those. If she couldn&#x2019;t go clubbin&#x2019;, she&#x2019;d go jukin&#x2019;.<br> <br>Night came on and the stars unrolled across the sky from east to west like a rug with spangles in it. A half-moon rose between two peaks and sat there, casting a sickroom glow over this stretch of the highway and the open land on both sides of it. The wind whistled beneath the eaves of the station, but out here it made a strange open humming that was not quite a vibration. It made him think of Pammy Andreeson&#x2019;s hopscotch chant.<br> <br>He walked listening for the sound of an oncoming train behind him. He didn&#x2019;t hear that; what he heard when the wind dropped was a minute but perfectly audible click-click-click. He turned and saw a wolf standing about twenty paces behind him on the broken passing line of Route 26. It was almost as big as a calf, its coat as shaggy as a Russian hat. In the starshine its fur looked black, its eyes a dark urine yellow. It saw David looking and stopped. Its mouth dropped open in a grin, and it began to pant, the sound of a small engine.<br> <br>There was no time to be afraid. He took a step toward it, clapped his hands, and shouted, &#x201c;Get out of here! Go on, now!&#x201d;<br> <br>The wolf turned tail and fled, leaving a pile of steaming droppings behind on Route 26. David grinned but managed to keep from laughing out loud; he thought that would be tempting the gods. He felt both scared and absurdly, totally cool. He thought of changing his name from David Sanderson to Wolf Frightener. That would be quite the name for an investment banker.<br> <br>Then he did laugh a little&#x2014;he couldn&#x2019;t help it&#x2014;and turned toward Crowheart Springs again. This time he walked looking over his shoulder as well as from side to side, but the wolf didn&#x2019;t come back. What came was a certainty that he would hear the shriek of the special coming to pick up the others; the part of their train that was still on the tracks would have been cleared away from the junction, and soon the people waiting in the station back there would be on their way again&#x2014;the Palmers, the Landers, the limping Biggers, the dancing Pammy, and all the rest.<br> <br>Well, so what? Amtrak would hold their luggage in San Francisco; surely they could be trusted to get that much right. He and Willa could find the local bus station. Greyhound must have discovered Wyoming.<br> <br>He came upon a Budweiser can and kicked it awhile. Then he kicked it crooked, off into the scrub, and as he was debating whether or not to go after it, he heard faint music: a bass line and the cry of a pedal steel guitar, which always sounded to him like chrome teardrops. Even in happy songs.<br> <br>She was there, listening to that music. Not because it was the closest place with music, but because it was the right place. He knew it. So he left the beer can and walked on toward the pedal steel, his sneakers scuffing up dust that the wind whipped away. The sound of the drum kit came next, then a red neon arrow below a sign that just read 26. Well, why not? This was Route 26, after all. It was a perfectly logical name for a honky-tonk.<br> <br>It had two parking lots, the one in front paved and packed with pickup trucks and cars, most American and most at least five years old. The lot on the left was gravel. In that one, ranks of long-haul semis stood under brilliant blue-white arc sodiums. By now David could also hear the rhythm and lead guitars, and read the marquee over the door: ONE NIGHT ONLY THE DERAILERS $5 COVER SORRY.<br> <br>The Derailers, he thought. Well, she certainly found the right group.<br> <br>David had a five in his wallet, but the foyer of 26 was empty. Beyond it, a big hardwood dance floor was crammed with slow-dancing couples, most wearing jeans and cowboy boots and clutching each other&#x2019;s butts as the band worked its wa...</p><h2>How to Make a Cherry Pie and See the U.S.A.</h2><p><i>Fancy a slice of cherry pie?

She has the ingredients this time, but she's missing the equipment (bowl, pan, rolling pin, etc.) needed to get the job done. Traveling back and forth across the United States according to instructions that are given recipe style (and can be followed on the endpapers' map), she gathers natural resources from various regions (e.g., cotton from Louisiana to make pot holders) and heads home to manufacture the required objects. Smelting, spinning, weaving, carving, and glass making, the girl works until she has everything ready. The pie is a welcome addition to a July 4th celebration, where floats showcase the places she has visited. Priceman's story is expertly matched to her gouache paintings; loose and sketchy, vivid and childlike, they offer myriad details for each locale. In a school setting, the story is useful for introducing a unit on the United States and for teaching predicting skills.

It could be said that knowing the parables is essential for understanding the person of Christ. In this work, Brad Young displays his unique perspective as a scholar steeped in both Jewish and Christian studies. While parables have timeless messages, reinterpretations in new contexts throughout the centuries have distorted the original meanings and undermined the essence of what Jesus intended for his initial listeners. Young examines the parables that best illustrate the parallels between the rabbinic and Gospel parables. He challenges readers to remember that first-century Judaism was not merely the backdrop for Jesus&#39; teachings but the very stage from which Jesus delivered the message of the kingdom. Jesus&#39; ethics and theology can be properly understood only in the light of first-century Jewish teachings. Young focuses on the historical development and theological significance of parables in both traditions and examines five theological subjects that are dealt with in parables: prayer, grace, reconciliation, calling, and sovereignty.</p><p>Fully one-third of Jesus' words in the Synoptic Gospels occur in parables.

Jewish thought is not--as is often claimed--merely a background for Jesus but is in reality the original context and natural framework of his message. . . . It is a very rare case that a New Testament scholar can break the language barrier and move freely in the Hebrew and Aramaic sources of early Judaism proficiently, as Young is able to do. . . .

Indeed, as award-winning historian Sean McMeekin reveals in <i>July 1914</i>, World War I might have been avoided entirely had it not been for the actions of a small group of statesmen in the month after the assassination. Whether they plotted for war or rode the whirlwind nearly blind, these men sought to capitalize on the fallout from Ferdinand's murder, unwittingly leading Europe toward the greatest cataclysm it had ever seen. A deeply-researched account of the genesis of World War I, <i>July 1914</i> tells the gripping story of the month that changed the course of the twentieth century.<br></p><p><b>Sean McMeekin</b> is a professor of history at Bard College. The award-winning author of several books, including <i>The Russian Revolution</i> and<i>The Ottoman Endgame</i>, McMeekin lives in Red Hook, New York.McMeekin&#x2019;s sally into the ever-burgeoning genre of WWI origin stories does not refrain, as does historian Christopher Clark&#x2019;s The Sleepwalkers, from apportioning blame for the outbreak of the war. This can be a tricky task for historians, complicated by documentary gaps about the July 1914 crisis, which indicate some of the power players involved destroyed or doctored evidence. Historian David Fromkin (Europe&#x2019;s Last Summer, 2004) seized on this to indict Germany as the primary instigator of WWI. While hardly absolving Germany, McMeekin argues that the principal suspects are the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Sazonov, and the French president, Raymond Poincar�, both of whom also altered evidence during the same period. McMeekin incorporates diplomatic exchanges among the powers, which both acknowledge responsibility and attempt to saddle their opponents with the brunt of it, and grants the Entente powers better success than the Triple Alliance at the high-risk, not to say cynical, operation of assigning blame for starting a continental European war. Alluding to historical controversies, McMeekin ably delivers what readers demand from a WWI-origins history: a taut rendition of the July 1914 crisis. --Gilbert Taylor</p><h2>Fivefold Ministry Made Practical: How to release apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors and teachers to equip today?s church</h2><p>Taking a look at how the fivefold ministers relate to the church today...Discover how the fivefold ministry was created to work within the local church, the training ground for ministry.

In many ways&#x2014;some even beyond our conscious awareness&#x2014;those old dynamics of our youth continue to play out in every business meeting, every social gathering, in our personal relationships, and even how we raise our children.

That woman was Paula, a friend of mine from college. When I first met her, Paula had brown, tousled hair, and recently had lost some significant weight. Today, she is an ER nurse. She is married, has two sons, and has become a bit of a fashionista&#x2014;always buying new shoes and trendy handbags. Nevertheless, she usually still thinks of herself as &#x201c;that pudgy girl with the sloppy hair,&#x201d; and on that Tuesday evening, she texted me just before the start of the school board meeting at her son&#x2019;s middle school. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s all coming back to me while I sit here. The teasing, the anxiety, the homework. I feel like someone may shoot a spitball at any moment. :)&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Paula was at the meeting to lobby for funds that would revitalize a gifted program she desperately wanted for her children. After six months of trying without any progress, she was losing patience. She&#x2019;d written a coherent proposal, developed a budget, gathered data from comparable programs in nearby districts, and even asked a few teachers to testify on behalf of her idea.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;If we have a better gifted program, fewer parents will send their children to the local private school,&#x201d; she argued. &#x201c;The retention of gifted children in the school system will lead to better test scores and a return to the levels of state funding we had three years ago. The program will essentially pay for itself.&#x201d; But the previous month, the board had allocated funds for a faculty lounge in the same school instead.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I checked in with Paula a few days later to see how her meeting had gone. She told me that just before it started, a woman named Susan showed up.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;She walks in, probably just to show off another new Birkin bag, and looks around the room like we&#x2019;re supposed to throw roses at her feet or something,&#x201d; Paula said.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Susan&#x2019;s daughter was in the same class as Paula&#x2019;s son. It was Susan&#x2019;s first appearance at a school board meeting. Several of the other parents in the room saw her and waved enthusiastically. One woman immediately ran over to give her a hug and cried, &#x201c;Oh my goodness, it has been so long. We have to catch up!&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Ugh, I got so annoyed when I saw how everyone kisses up to Susan,&#x201d; Paula told me. &#x201c;But I gave her a hug, too.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The meeting started, and the board president began by soliciting ideas for how to help the school develop a higher profile within the district. A few minutes into the discussion, Susan stood up and addressed the room.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I agree that we need to think about how to make ourschool stand out. I was visiting my sister last week in Michigan, and a few kids from the gifted program at her kid&#x2019;s middle school had just won a science tournament. The next thing you know, the school was in the paper, and the drug company that sponsored the tournament gave the school a big donation. Why don&#x2019;t we do that here? Do we even have a gifted program?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Within thirty minutes, the board voted to approve additional funding for the program. Paula was both elated and furious&#x2014;it was great news for her son, but in a few minutes, Susan had achieved what Paula hadn&#x2019;t been able to do in six months. Susan hadn&#x2019;t offered any new arguments or presented any research on school funding trends. But somehow, her ideas got traction.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Everyone is always just so excited to do whatever Susan wants,&#x201d; Paula complained. &#x201c;Sometimes I can&#x2019;t stand it.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;<br><br></p><p>Joe is a professor at a well-known university. He&#x2019;s been on staff for ten years, but was not supposed to be next in line for a promotion. His more senior colleague, Franklin, has been in the same position three years longer and has a more impressive record of scientific publications. In just the past year, Franklin obtained a prestigious grant to support his work, and a top journal featured one of his papers as its lead article, suggesting that his research was making a very important impact in the field.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Joe has also been publishing, but in journals of much lesser quality, and he has never been awarded a grant.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Nevertheless, everyone loves Joe. He always has something amusing to offer at faculty meetings. He regularly makes the rounds up and down the halls of his department, having energetic doorway conversations, and he&#x2019;s always open-minded to whatever opinions are expressed when department politics emerge. People reflexively smile when they see him.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That is not the case with Franklin, though. In fact, heis so contentious that his very name has become an adjective in the department, as in: &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s add this to the consent agenda, so no one gets all <i>Franklin</i> about it.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>At one faculty meeting, the agenda included a discussion about which of two courses should be added to the requirements for a second undergraduate major offered by the department. A committee that had spent the past three months developing the proposal outlined the pros and cons for each of the course selections, and then asked for comments and questions. As Franklin&#x2019;s hand launched up, the rest of the faculty shifted in their chairs and avoided eye contact with him.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know why we want a second major at all,&#x201d; he began. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been saying for years that this is a huge waste of time that puts burden on our staff, and also on us. I spent three hours last week meeting with students about this, and I don&#x2019;t even know why we have it. One major is enough for our department!&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Groans could be heard all around the room. Many of the faculty lowered their heads, ostensibly to check something on their phones. After a moment of uncomfortable silence, the committee chair opened the discussion to other comments. A few people praised the committee for its work and expressed a clear rationale for which course should complete the major requirements. A consensus quickly became evident, with enthusiastic nodding around the room.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But Franklin was not convinced. &#x201c;Look, I think this is a huge mistake,&#x201d; he said, interrupting the next speaker. &#x201c;You are all going to wish you had stopped this second major when you had the chance,&#x201d; at which he defiantly picked up his iPad and tuned out for the rest of the meeting.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Two weeks later, a senior professorship opened just above the level occupied by both Franklin and Joe. It was Joe who received the promotion.</p><p>&nbsp;<br><br></p><p>Jennifer is a successful statistician who works at a federally funded research center that is testing new cancer drugs. By age thirty-five, she already had become the director of her unit at the institute and the president of a national professional society for statisticians, and she had even been invited to the White House as a member of an expert panel. She also is deeply in love with her wife of fifteen years, an oncologist.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But Jennifer is not happy. In fact, on many days she&#x2019;s pretty down on herself. Even though she knows she is doing well professionally, she just can&#x2019;t shake the feeling that she is somehow inferior to her colleagues. The same despondency affects her relationships. Her wife often tells her how much she loves her, but Jennifer feels as if she is incessantly being judged and criticized. Even with friends or coworkers, she senses that everyone has made plans but excluded her. <i>Everyone is just so arrogant</i>, she would think. <i>They&#x2019;re no better than me</i>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, when Jennifer was recruited to lead a team on a new high-profile grant in North Carolina&#x2019;s Research Triangle, she was more than happy to move. She chose a little neighborhood in Chapel Hill called Southern Village. Ever the statistician, she loved how this community had been developed based on modern urban planning research. The constellation of apartments, town houses, and single-family homes, which collectively encircled an old-fashioned town square, was designed to foster community engagement and social interaction. The urban planning principles seemed to work&#x2014;the town square indeed became a hub of almost utopian friendly exchange, like a scene from <i>The Truman Show</i>. On the first Wednesday of each month, the neighborhood sponsored a dog parade. On Friday evenings, the community assembled on the green in the center of the square to watch movies and share a picnic dinner. <i>This is just the place to feel at home</i>, Jennifer thought.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But after six years there, not much had changed for her. Jennifer still listened to her coworkers make happy-hour plans, but she was not invited. When she went to the green on movie nights, she resented that everyone who came by talked more to her wife than to her. And she was particularly annoyed every morning by the sight of the neighbors who would stand at the foot of her driveway chatting with one another. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know what I ever did to them,&#x201d; she once told me, &#x201c;but they never ask me to go running, or to yoga, or anything&#x2014;even if I am standing right next to them!&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;<br><br></p><p>Alan is forty-six years old and has a weakness for pie. He has a very nice office in downtown Sunnyville but he hadn&#x2019;t been at his desk all week. Instead, he sat in the last booth at the local diner to catch the view from the huge bay window right next to his table. On a clear day, this was an ideal spot to see the whole shopping district downtown, and on this particular afternoon, he had covered not only his table but the one next to it with file folders, Post-its, and empty cups of coffee strategically placed on top of papers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>No one at Sunnyville Diner seemed to mind. One of the waitresses, Lateesha, waved at him when she began her shift.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;The day hasn&#x2019;t really begun until I see you!&#x201d; Alan called out. Lateesha smiled while playfully holding a dish towel over her face.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When Donna, the hostess who had recently separated from her husband, came to his table, he held her hand in both of his and asked, &#x201c;How are you holding up?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Even the chef gave him a nod and a smile as he walked tothe front of the diner. &#x201c;Best pie yet!&#x201d; Alan told him with his mouth full.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>At about 5 p.m., Alan was greeted by Mike, a colleague from his former real estate development firm.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Hey, looks like you&#x2019;ve moved in,&#x201d; Mike joked. &#x201c;Working on a pitch?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Yup, north side of town. Ten acres, mixed-use&nbsp; development, plus a new hotel,&#x201d; Alan replied, pointing to the coffee cup at the edge of the table. As Mike questioned him about the project, Alan used a laser pointer to trace the perimeter of the property, the stream that would cut through it, and the new set of apartments, marked by a sugar dispenser in the middle of the table.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Mike hadn&#x2019;t blinked in at least a minute as he listened to Alan&#x2019;s plan and finally shook his head. &#x201c;You have no fear, man. The northside? Really? Here in Sunnyville? You know they turned us down when we pitched there last year. &#x2018;This generation will never see development in that part of town,&#x2019; they told us. Good luck, you&#x2019;re going to need it!&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Alan&#x2019;s presentation to the town council lasted over three hours. And for most of it, things did not look good. Just fifteen minutes into his presentation, two council members interrupted him to say that they were simply not going to be able to support the project.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;This isn&#x2019;t a sound investment for Sunnyville,&#x201d; one of them asserted. &#x201c;The implications for the traffic and road repair alone are far too substantial to seriously consider any type of mixed-use development in that part of town.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But Alan persisted, armed with graphs, town records from the archives, and the testimony of experts from nearby properties he had developed who were ready to comment on his successful track record. But mostly,Alan had a patient, nondefensive, and unwaveringly enthusiastic demeanor as he calmly described every detail of the planned development. When his estimate ofthe project&#x2019;s finances was disputed, he smiled, took a step back, and walked his inquisitor through his figures. When the town council members challenged his ideas for possible commercial uses of the property, Alan was firm, but open-minded. When they questioned his proposed timeline, he made a joke and agreed with their assessment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>By 9 p.m., the council members were ready to allow questions from the town&#x2019;s residents in attendance. One spoke critically of the proposal and also shouted an insult directly at Alan. He took it in stride, even self-effacingly. When other citizens praised him, he was modest, and when they embarrassed themselves with incomprehensible questions, he rescued their dignity. Finally, after thirty minutes of discussion, it was time for a vote.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The proposal passed unanimously. The onlookers applauded as Alan closed the biggest deal of his career. Many were excited about the changes coming to their town. But as some shook his hand to congratulate him, it almost seemed as if they were rooting more for Alan than the proposal itself.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>After everyone left, Alan remained in his chair for a few moments, in stunned disbelief. Mike had witnessed the entire meeting and now walked over to offer his own congratulations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I am so glad I pulled those old town records,&#x201d; Alan said. &#x201c;I think that may be what got them.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Mike shook his head and patted his friend on the back. &#x201c;It wasn&#x2019;t the records,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;It wasn&#x2019;t the experts, and it wasn&#x2019;t even the breaks you offered them. We did all of that last year, and they never agreed to a single proposal. It was <i>you</i>, man. They didn&#x2019;t vote for the project, they voted for <i>you</i>.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;<br><br></p><p>Everyone knows a story like these. Some of our coworkers and neighbors are consistently successful, and not for the reasons we might expect, while others don&#x2019;t get their way no matter how hard they try. We also all have peers who feel excluded in every context, while others have mysterious confidence and consistent social success. We may think we left the mores of high school behind us, but popularity is still very much a part of the adult playground. It is that one factor that no one really talks about, yet it makes a big difference in our lives. Popularity dynamics affect our careers, our success in meeting our goals, our personal and professional relationships, and ultimately our happiness.<br>The ongoing importance of popularity in adulthood was a surprise even to me, until I learned a lesson from my own students.<br>In August 2001, something strange was taking place on the campus of Yale University.

Each book contains an engaging adventure revolving around a &#x2018;build-it-yourself&#x2019; science project.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Teacher Librarian</i><br><br>&#x201c;Real project blueprints are included along with this tale of 11-year-old siblings who create outrageous contraptions and top-secret gadgets.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Los Angeles Times</i></p><p><b>&#x201c;Science Bob&#x201d; Pflugfelder&nbsp;</b>is an elementary school teacher based in Newton, Massachusetts. He has made many television appearances on&nbsp;<i>Jimmy Kimmel Live</i>,&nbsp;<i>The Dr. Oz Show</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Live With Kelly and Michael</i>, among other media outlets.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><b>Steve Hockensmith&nbsp;</b>is the author of a&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;best seller (<i>Price and Prejudice and Zombies: Dawn of the Dreadfuls</i>) and an Edgar Award nominee (<i>Holmes on the Range</i>).There was a muffled boom, and&nbsp;then the whole house seemed&nbsp;to rise about half an inch before&nbsp;slamming down again. The lights&nbsp;flickered but stayed on.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nick and Tesla Holt listened intently.&nbsp;After a moment, they could&nbsp;hear faint coughing coming from<br> downstairs.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I&#x2019;m all right!&#x201d; their uncle said&nbsp;from the basement. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t have&nbsp;to call the fire department this<br> time!&#x201d; Uncle Newt was an inventor&nbsp;and a scientist, and he&#x2019;d recently set&nbsp;aside his favorite project&#x2014;a compost-powered vacuum cleaner&#x2014;to&nbsp;begin work on something that he wouldn&#x2019;t tell his&nbsp;niece and nephew about. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a surprise!&#x201d; Uncle Newt&nbsp;shouted, coughing a bit more. That was all he ever&nbsp;said about his new endeavor, no matter how many&nbsp;times Nick and Tesla asked him about it.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;It would really be a surprise,&#x201d; Nick said to his sister,&nbsp;&#x201c;if his &#x2018;whatever-it-is&#x2019; didn&#x2019;t blow up all the time.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;He could be tinkering with a new flavor of ice&nbsp;cream, and there&#x2019;d be a 99 percent chance it would&nbsp;go up in flames,&#x201d; Tesla said to her twin brother.&nbsp;They&#x2019;d known their uncle only since the beginning&nbsp;of the summer, when they&#x2019;d been sent to stay with&nbsp;him in Half Moon Bay while their parents traveled&nbsp;abroad. But they&#x2019;d soon realized that anything their&nbsp;inventor uncle happened to be working on was&nbsp;prone to exploding.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nick was sitting on the floor of the bedroom he&nbsp;and Tesla shared, hunched over a battered but functional&nbsp;laptop (which they also shared). He shrugged&nbsp;at Tesla and then looked down again at the computer.&nbsp;When he clicked the mouse, a black-and-white&nbsp;image of a man with dark hair and a thick mustache,&nbsp;dressed in old-fashioned clothes, appeared on the&nbsp;screen. Tesla recognized the man instantly.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was Tesla. <i>Nikola </i>Tesla, that is. The brilliant,&nbsp;eccentric inventor after whom she and Nick (&#x201c;Nikola,&#x201d;&nbsp;according to his birth certificate) had been&nbsp;named by their parents. (Who were also scientists&nbsp;but, unlike Uncle Newt, had never blown anything&nbsp;up. At least as far as Nick and Tesla knew.)<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nick scrolled down and another image slid into&nbsp;place: a long, single-story brick building with, looming&nbsp;over it, a tower topped by a huge, bulbous dome.&nbsp;Tesla recognized this picture, too. It showed Wardenclyffe&nbsp;Tower, which was sometimes called Tesla&nbsp;Tower. Nikola Tesla had built it over a century ago.&nbsp;It was supposed to transmit electric power through&nbsp;the air like radio signals . . . except it had never&nbsp;worked properly.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nick had been obsessively researching wireless&nbsp;power transmission for days. He was convinced&nbsp;it had something to do with their mom and dad&#x2019;s&nbsp;disappearance. Supposedly their parents had left&nbsp;the twins with Uncle Newt so that they could fly to&nbsp;Uzbekistan to research soybean irrigation. Yet they&nbsp;had been out of touch ever since, and Nick and Tesla&nbsp;eventually found themselves being shadowed by&nbsp;spies and government agents. It was one of those&nbsp;agents who&#x2019;d suggested that wireless energy transfer,&nbsp;the kind that Nikola Tesla tried to invent, had&nbsp;something to do with their parents&#x2019; vanishing.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;You know,&#x201d; Nick said, without looking up from&nbsp;the laptop, &#x201c;someone with a real, working Tesla<br> Tower could put every oil and gas company out of&nbsp;business overnight. Maybe that&#x2019;s why it has to be&nbsp;such a big secret.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;And someone with a real, working magic wand&nbsp;could turn the Great Lakes into chocolate syrup and&nbsp;put Hershey&#x2019;s out of business, but that doesn&#x2019;t mean&nbsp;it&#x2019;s going to happen,&#x201d; Tesla answered.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Yeah, well, we&#x2019;re a lot closer to having wireless&nbsp;power transmission than we are to magic wands.&#x201d;<br> Now that he was getting excited, Nick looked up at&nbsp;his sister to continue the debate. &#x201c;That solar power&nbsp;company Solanow has a prototype energy emitter,&nbsp;right?&nbsp;And the Japanese government wants to build&nbsp;a network of space-based solar power transmitters.&nbsp;And&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I&#x2019;m just glad Uncle Newt&#x2019;s not working on wireless&nbsp;power transmission,&#x201d; Tesla said, interrupting<br> her brother. &#x201c;If he were, every electrical appliance&nbsp;on the West Coast would&#x2019;ve exploded already.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Ha,&#x201d; Nick said mirthlessly, and then he went&nbsp;back to staring at the computer screen.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Hey,&#x201d; Tesla said, trying not to sound like she&#x2019;d&nbsp;been planning to ask this question the whole time,<br> &#x201c;why don&#x2019;t you take a break and come help me? I&nbsp;need to build a stabilizer for Silas&#x2019;s video camera.&nbsp;Something that&#x2019;ll help him get cool, smooth shots.&nbsp;He&#x2019;s at DeMarco&#x2019;s house right now filming his superhero&nbsp;movie. You know, <i>Bald Eagle: The Legend Takes</i>&nbsp;<i>Flight</i>. You should see DeMarco&#x2019;s little sister Elesha&nbsp;in that green alien makeup we made for them.&#x201c;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Tesla was talking about Silas Kuskie and DeMarco&nbsp;Davison, the only friends she and her brother had&nbsp;made (so far) during their stay in Half Moon Bay. Nick&nbsp;believed that no <i>normal </i>kids would want the kind&nbsp;of trouble that he and his sister tended to get into.&nbsp;But DeMarco was an adrenaline junkie, always up&nbsp;for something exciting and a little dangerous. And&nbsp;Silas . . . well, let&#x2019;s just say that thinking ahead about&nbsp;the kind of trouble he might get into&#x2014;or thinking&nbsp;ahead about anything, for that matter&#x2014;just wasn&#x2019;t&nbsp;his style.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nick didn&#x2019;t even look up as his sister continued&nbsp;her pitch.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Silas shot some footage of their stunt dummy&nbsp;dressed as the Bald Eagle, and the video was so jumpy&nbsp;and jerky that just watching it made Monique&#x201d;&#x2014;Monique&nbsp;was DeMarco&#x2019;s even littler sister&#x2014;&#x201c;puke all&nbsp;over the yard.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nick kept typing. Tesla frowned. She was sure&nbsp;Nick would enjoy the idea of one of DeMarco&#x2019;s nasty&nbsp;little sisters getting so sick that she vomited. The&nbsp;two girls had been tormenting DeMarco ever since&nbsp;they were old enough to throw things at his head.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;So, Silas needs something like a Steadicam,&#x201d;<br> Tesla continued. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve seen those, right?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nick still didn&#x2019;t respond.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a frame that spreads out a movie camera&#x2019;s&nbsp;center of gravity via a counterbalance, making it easy&nbsp;to smoothly manipulate the camera with a special&nbsp;kind of joint called a gimbal.&#x201d; Tesla kept talking even&nbsp;though Nick continued to ignore her. &#x201c;Like the ones&nbsp;gyroscopes have. So, your video camera stays level&nbsp;instead of bouncing and jerking around and you get&nbsp;nice, even shots.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I know what a Steadicam is,&#x201d; Nick answered.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Well, we can&#x2019;t make the real thing, of course.&nbsp;But I have some ideas for a simpler version that&nbsp;would work with that little video camera Silas uses.&#x201d;&nbsp;Then Tesla had an idea. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll call it a Silascam,&#x201d; she&nbsp;said. &#x201c;No, a Teslacam. No, wait&#x2014;a Nickandteslacam.&nbsp;It could probably work with a phone camera, too.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Great. Go make it without me.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I can, of course. But it&#x2019;d be a lot easier <i>with&nbsp;</i>you.&#x201d; Usually, Nick and Tesla built all kinds of<br> things together: vinegar and liquid-soap &#x201c;volcanoes,&#x201d;&nbsp;homemade rock candy, robots, super-cyborg<br> gadget gloves. Last week, they&#x2019;d created an animatronic&nbsp;arm, mostly out of ice-pop sticks, which Silas<br> used in his movie along with the alien makeup.&nbsp;They&#x2019;d also helped Silas and DeMarco put together a<br> stunt dummy for the action scenes (even stuntmanwannabe&nbsp;DeMarco had no interest in falling down&nbsp;a flight of stairs, jumping from an attic window,&nbsp;or doing any of the other crazy tricks Silas came<br> up with). Tesla tried to distract herself from all&nbsp;the weirdness and worries about their parents by&nbsp;keeping busy with one project after another. Lately,&nbsp;however, Nick hadn&#x2019;t been trying to distract himself&nbsp;from those concerns. On the contrary: he&#x2019;d&nbsp;been wallowing in them, trying to find an answer&nbsp;by scouring the Internet for clues.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And now Tesla wanted to build something, anything,&nbsp;with her brother.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nick clicked on a link, and a new webpage&nbsp;opened on-screen. The title was &#x201c;The SHOCKING&nbsp;Truth behind Tesla&#x2019;s Death Ray.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Sorry,&#x201d; Nick said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m busy.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Tesla said, &#x201c;you&#x2019;re obsessed.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nick didn&#x2019;t respond. So Tesla decided it was time&nbsp;to play dirty.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;You know, I found something really interesting&nbsp;online last night,&#x201d; Tesla said. &#x201c;Here, let me show<br> you.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She plopped down next to her brother and shouldered&nbsp;him away from the keyboard.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Hey!&#x201d; he said in protest.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;This&#x2019;ll just take a sec. Trust me, you&#x2019;re going to&nbsp;be amazed.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Tesla opened a folder on the desktop, found the&nbsp;icon she was looking for&#x2014;a tiny traffic signal&#x2014;and&nbsp;double-clicked it.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;There,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Done.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nick squinted at the screen.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Nothing&#x2019;s happening,&#x201d; he said.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Exactly. I just turned on Stoplite.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;What&#x2019;s Stoplite?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;A program that automatically freezes your computer&nbsp;for six hours, so you won&#x2019;t waste your whole<br> day on it.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;<i>What</i>?&#x201d; Nick shoved his sister aside and began&nbsp;jabbing at the keyboard. The screen remained frozen.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll just restart it,&#x201d; he said.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He held down the power button but . . . nothing&nbsp;happened.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Stoplite&#x2019;s really good,&#x201d; Tesla said.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Oh, man! This is <i>not </i>funny, Tez!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not supposed to be funny. It&#x2019;s supposed to&nbsp;get you off your butt so you&#x2019;ll come downstairs and&nbsp;help me.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Oh, yeah, right. Like I&#x2019;m going to help you after&nbsp;you did <i>this</i>.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nick folded his arms across his chest and stared&nbsp;at the wall.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Suit yourself,&#x201d; Tesla said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going down to the&nbsp;lab to get the parts. If Silas never finishes his cinematic&nbsp;masterpiece and doesn&#x2019;t become the world&#x2019;s&nbsp;greatest twelve-year-old film director, it won&#x2019;t be my&nbsp;fault.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She got up and headed for the door.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nick stayed put.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Well, good luck building your little whatever,&#x201d;&nbsp;he said with a growl. &#x201c;Because you won&#x2019;t be getting<br> any help from me.&#x201d;</p><h2>Eating Your Way Through Luke&#39;s Gospel</h2><p><p>Robert Karris spreads before us a unique and delightful framing of the food theme in the Gospel of Luke.</p> <p>Karris describes the food and drink popular in Jesus' day. He also documents the social, political, and general contexts in which the food was prepared and eaten. He outlines the social roles Jesus assumes in Luke's Gospel in relation to food and meals, as well as the relationship between women and food. Karris also examines the eucharistic implications of the way food and drink are portrayed.</p> <p>This volume invites readers to get actively involved in the process of discovery by checking Scripture references alongside the author. Food themes in the other three Gospels are also briefly compared with Luke's Gospel. Questions to stimulate an appetite for discussion or reflection and suggestions for further reading are provided at the end of each chapter.</p> <p><i>Robert J.

Best of all, it is a comprehensive view of meals and food in many gospels. Rich in background and detail and perceptive of the symbolism of food, guests and fellowship, Karris&#x2019; study is tasty, nourishing and digestible.

He then uses this knowledge to illuminate Jesus&#x2019; eating habits, his actions and teachings at meals, and the food imagery in his parables. Karris has fashioned a &#x2018;meal&#x2019; that provides enticing and nourishing food for thought, meat for good homilies, and staples for a life of Christian discipleship.<i>Marion C.

It provides a window into the faith and practice of the earliest Gentiles disciples and the instructions they received from the Jewish apostles. The Didache was considered an early discipleship manual for those coming to faith. Its wisdom and simplicity are still relevant for us today. <br><br> The Way of Life is a new complete translation of the text, with an extensive Messianic Jewish verse-by-verse commentary. It exposes a historic and authentic Messianic Jewish faith expression for Gentiles that accepted the yoke of the Messiah. While there have been a plethora of commentaries on the Didache from Christian and even Jewish points of view, this is the first major work from a Messianic Jewish perspective. The Way of Life will benefit both Messianic Jews and Gentiles who desire to study the priorities and life of the earliest believers in Yeshua. <br><br> In 1880 Greek Orthodox archbishop Philotheos Bryennios rediscovered the Didache in a monastery in Istanbul. The Didache enjoyed wide circulation in the early church and some even considered it canonical. Numerous church writers mention the text but somewhere around the fifth century the work disappeared. So when Bishop Bryennios found the book in 1880, the Didache had been missing for about 1400 years. <br><br> The Didache picks up right where the Apostolic Decree leaves off, teaching and clarifying for Gentiles their relationship to the Torah and place in Messianic Judaism. It was written by the early Jewish believers in Yeshua and contains teaching that claims to have its origin with the twelve apostles. Some scholars feel its earliest version might have been written as early as 50 CE, which places it within the first generation of disciples of Yeshua. It may even contain material older than many of Paul s epistles and the Gospel of John. It also contains teachings of Yeshua that are not found in the canonical Gospels. <br><br> The Didache offers us an incredible window into the daily life of believers at a time when Christianity still functioned as a sect within Judaism and not a separate religion. It shows us practical life in early Messianic Judaism. <br><br> The Way of Life, Features <br> - Casebound hardcover, 600 pages <br> - The Didache, a new parallel Greek/English translation <br> - Comprehensive verse-by-verse commentary on the text of the Didache <br> - Extensive notes and cross-references to scriptural and Jewish sources <br> - Numerous practical instructions for modern believers based on the text <br></p><p>Toby Janicki is the director of the 12-21 Messianic Youth Initiative of First Fruits of Zion.

A former animator for Dreamworks, she lives with her husband and two sons in Los Angeles.PreS-Gr 2&#x2014;Pace and Pham have combined their talents to create another mesmerizing story of Vampirina. It's time for Moon Monster Madness, so all the monster families head to the beach for a night of fun. The watercolor and pen-and-ink illustrations bring the summer festival to life (or should that be undeath?). The protagonist's tips combine her optimistic outlook with her love of ballet. For instance, she says in a game of volleyball, "You must leap high, stay light on your toes, and always hit your mark." Vampirina's advice for beachgoers is always positive but never cloying. Vampirina and her friend try everything from surfing to building sand castles. Their participation in an underwater treasure hunt is depicted on a rich spread of blues and greens, filled with pops of color from pink starfish, purple coral, and the big red X that marks the spot. Pham's artwork delicately depicts nighttime scenes without making them appear gloomy or frightening. The four-page foldout of the dance contest is a feast for the eyes and shares some good advice: "Whether or not you come out on top, finishing with grace is what makes you a real winner." This is a story that will be read and reread, with new details springing out of the illustrations each time. VERDICT Perfect for existing fans of Vampirina and newcomers to this feisty character and her nocturnal world. A sublime seasonal storytime selection.&#x2014;Suzanne Costner, Fairview Elementary School, Maryville, TN</p><h2>The Naked Anabaptist: The Bare Essentials of a Radical Faith, Fifth Anniversary Edition</h2><p>Anabaptist Christians have been around for almost 500 years.

The animals, plants, and people that inhabited the lands beyond Europe were unknown, at least as far as the Western world was concerned. The rivers and jungles of the Amazon, the Badlands of Pata - gonia and of the American West, the tropical forests of Indonesia, the savannah and center of Africa, the vast interior of Central Asia, the polar regions, and the many chains of islands that dot the oceans were complete mysteries.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And, while our knowledge of the world&#x2019;s living inhabitants was slim, our grasp of our planet&#x2019;s past was nonexistent. Fossils had been known for millennia, but they were seen in the light of local mythologies about dragons and other imagined creatures, not in the light of natural science.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our sense of the time scale of life on earth? Vague and vastly off the mark.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And our picture of our own species&#x2019; history? A set of fantastic myths and fairy tales.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The explorations of the previously unseen parts of the world and the unearthing of the history of life and our origins are some of the greatest achievements in human history. This book tells the stories of some of the most dramatic adventures and important discoveries in two centuries of natural history&#x2014; from the epic journeys of pioneering naturalists to the expeditions making headlines today &#x2014; and how they inspired and have expanded one of the greatest ideas of modern science: evolution.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will encounter many amazing creatures of the past and present, but the most remarkable creatures in these stories are the men and women. They are, without exception, remarkable people who have experienced and accomplished extraordinary things. They have lived the kinds of lives that Twain extolled&#x2014; they walked where no others had walked, saw what no one else had seen, and thought what no one else had thought.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The people in these stories followed their dreams&#x2014; to travel to faraway lands, to see wild and exotic places, to collect beautiful, rare, or strange animals, or to find the remains of extinct beasts or human ancestors. Very few started out with any notion of great achievement or fame. Several lacked formal education or training. Rather, they were driven by a passion to explore nature, and they were willing, sometimes eager, to take great risks to pursue their dreams. Many faced the perils of traveling long distances by sea. Some confronted the extreme climates of deserts, jungles, or the Arctic. Many left behind skeptical and anxious loved ones, and a few endured years of unimaginable loneliness.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their triumphs were much more than survival and the collecting of specimens from around the world. A few pioneers, provoked by a riot of diversity beyond their wildest imaginations, were transformed from collectors into scientists. They posed and pondered the most fundamental questions about Nature. Their answers sparked a revolution that changed, profoundly and forever, our perception of the living world and our place within it.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unlike their privileged countrymen back in the universities, churches, and drawing rooms of Europe, most of whom believed that the origins of living things was a matter outside the realm of natural science, these explorers asked not just what existed, but wondered how and why these creatures came to be. Unlike their teachers, who pursued a natural theology that interpreted everything in Nature as part of the design of a Creator &#x2014; peaceful, harmonious, stable, and unchanging &#x2014; this new cadre of naturalists discovered that Nature was, in fact, a dynamic and perpetual battleground in which creatures competed and struggled to survive, a war in which they either adapted and changed or were exterminated. Unlike their predecessors, who explained the distribution of living species in the world much as one would the instant and premeditated placement of pieces on a chessboard, these naturalists discovered that the world and the life it contained had a very long history that shaped where various plants and animals were found across the globe. And, unlike their contemporaries who viewed everything in Nature as being purposely created for man&#x2019;s benefit and domination, they rejected that conceit and placed humans within the animal kingdom, with our own earthly origins.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The torch of this revolution has been passing from generation to generation of scientists who have been walking, literally and figuratively, in the footsteps of these pioneers.<br> <i><br> A mixture of spirit and deed<br> </i>My goals in writing this book are to bring to life the pursuit and the pleasure of scientific discovery, at the same time capturing the significance of each advance for evolutionary science. The idea here is that science is far better understood and enjoyed, and made memorable, when we follow the bumpy roads of the scientists that led, eventually, to their achievements. It is not an original idea. Like the naturalists described here who trod in their predecessors&#x2019; footsteps, I am following the lead of authors such as Paul de Kruif (Microbe Hunters) and C. W. Ceram (Gods, Graves, and Scholars), whose works brought the passion and excitement of the glory days of microbiology and archaeology, respectively, to many readers. The stories I tell were chosen for both their dramatic content and scientific importance. I have, I confess, "cherry-picked" the rich lore of natural history for the best of the best.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ceram described adventure as "a mixture of spirit and deed." These stories are intended to capture those two elements in a compact form. They are crafted for enjoyment, not as scholarly biographies or histories of science. I have not delved into the biographical depth that would be necessary in full-length treatments. I have provided some background where I thought it would offer insights into who or what kindled the spirit of adventure in these naturalists and scientists.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wherever possible I relied on field notes, journals, expedition reports, and other firsthand accounts because they tend to contain the person&#x2019;s thoughts and reactions at critical moments. I also examined original scientific papers because they are the material of record of what exactly was found, concluded, and proposed. Many of the individuals or discoveries described here have also been the subject of one, several, or many excellent books, some written in the first person and others by biographers. You will find the many sources I relied on in "Sources and Further Reading," at the back of the book, and I certainly encourage you to explore them. I had a blast researching these stories.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This book is not a compendium of the greatest evolutionary scientists or discoveries (although many here would certainly be on any such list), nor is it a history of the field. But the individuals here do represent very well the spirit of the enterprise, and many scientists, myself included, have drawn inspiration from one or more of them. So if you sense a lack of objectivity and a hagiographic bent, I am guilty as charged. There is much to admire in the protagonists of these stories. I have not paid attention to whether someone was a good citizen, good with money, or even a good spouse (some were, some weren&#x2019;t). These people had (or have) very rewarding and satisfying lives because of the great pleasure they gained from what they have done. I did not want to write a book about miserable bastards (although, come to think of it, that might be fun and would make for a catchy title).<br> <i><br> The search for origins<br> </i>The scientific quest driving all of these stories is the search for the origins of species, what was referred to by early scientists and philosophers as "the mystery of mysteries," "the question of questions," or the "supreme problem of biology." I will begin my tales and set the stage for the main body of the book with a short account of one of the boldest and most important scientific voyages ever undertaken. I am not referring to Darwin&#x2019;s famous journey but to the expedition through South and Central America made three decades earlier by Alexander von Humboldt (Chapter 1). It has been said that all scientists are descendants of Humboldt, who in the course of his travels made contributions to virtually every branch of science. We will see, however, that the magnificent flora, fauna, and fossils were perceived very differently by this great explorer than by those who followed him. Though brilliant, Humboldt and his illustrious circle of friends belonged to an age that embraced a religious vision of nature. Humboldt thus offers a view of the world before the revolution, and though he did not perceive a solution to the mystery of mysteries or even that the problem of origins could be solved, his journey blazed the trail for and directly inspired the wave of naturalists who did.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The main body of the book is organized into three parts, each of which focuses on one major aspect of the search for origins &#x2014; of species in general (Part I), of particular kinds of animals (Part II), and of humans (Part III). Each part is preceded by a brief preamble that provides some background for the stories within it, and I have ordered the chapters in such a way that the connections between the scientists, discoveries, and ideas are highlighted in successive chapters. In Part I ("The Making of a Theory"), we follow the epic voyages of Charles Darwin and Alfred Wallace, who solved the origins problem, and of Henry Walter Bates, who discovered superb evidence of the process of natural selection. In Part II ("The Loveliest Bones"), we retrace several of the greatest expeditions and most spectacular finds in paleontology, which have thrown light on the origins of the animal kingdom and various major groups within it. And, in Part III ("The Natural History of Humans"), we track some discoveries from the archaeological and fossil records and explore new insights from the DNA record that have shaped our understanding of human origins.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This book debuts, not coincidentally, on the anniversaries of several milestones in natural history and evolutionary science. In 2009, we mark Charles Darwin&#x2019;s 200th birthday and the 150th anniversary of the publication of his On the Origin of Species. It is certainly fitting to celebrate the ideas and achievements of our greatest naturalist and the leader of this scientific revolution, and this book is in part my contribution to that party. We also mark the 100th anniversary of Charles Walcott&#x2019;s discovery of the remarkable animals of the Burgess Shale, which documented the Cambrian Explosion (Chapter 6), as well as the 50th anniversary of Mary and Louis Leakey&#x2019;s first ancient hominid find, which redirected the study of human origins back to Africa (Chapter 11).<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But my aim goes well beyond these famous events. There is, for example, another, less well known anniversary to recognize, and its being so less well known is a matter of some concern that I hope to redress in my own small way. One hundred and fifty years ago, on July 1, 1858, the fruit of Darwin&#x2019;s and Wallace&#x2019;s great adventures&#x2014; the theory of natural selection&#x2014; was first presented publicly before a small audience of the Linnean Society in London and subsequently published in the society&#x2019;s journal. For reasons not altogether clear, nor for which there would be a scholarly consensus, this event and Wallace&#x2019;s contributions to it tend to be overlooked. Indeed, the most widely used college biology textbooks typically offer many pages about Darwin&#x2019;s travels and work and just a few vague lines about Wallace: "a young British naturalist working in the East Indies who had developed a theory of natural selection similar to Darwin&#x2019;s." Wallace, I think, is in danger of disappearing from textbooks altogether. And that, I hope you will agree after reading Chapter 3, would be a shame.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is not a shame just because of the issue of credit in history. It is a shame because we are deprived of a great story of spirit and deed &#x2014; Wallace&#x2019;s two long journeys, with a shipwreck in between, and his dozen years in the forests of the Amazon and Indonesia, and how and why he came to similar ideas as Darwin did while toiling on the other side of the globe. It is an inspiring tale of great passion, dedication, physical risk and endurance, perseverance, and the immense pleasure of discovery. There is so much to learn from his struggles and triumphs and to admire in his character.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The same can be said of all the naturalists and scientists in this book. In fact, one of the most important experiences shared by virtually every person in these stories is that their discoveries and ideas were initially rejected or doubted. One might have thought that finding the first ape-man or a new dinosaur, or deciphering some critical piece of history in DNA, would confer instant glory. Think again. Many struggled for decades before gaining widespread acceptance and recognition. Such is the nature of breakthroughs and revolutions in science.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What also unites the naturalists here unites all of us as humans&#x2014; the urge to explore. New discoveries about the origins of our species reveal that most of us are the descendants of explorers, humans who migrated out of Africa just 60,000 years ago or so and eventually populated six continents (Chapter 13). Even if it may now be only from the safety of our armchairs or theater seats, we share a deep need to know the world around us.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In July 1976, on the eve of the historic landing of the Viking I spacecraft on Mars, NASA assembled a panel of luminaries, including the authors Roy Bradbury and James Michener, the physicist Philip Morrison, and the undersea explorer Jacques Cousteau, to discuss the motives for exploration. Most saw it as a matter of human instinct.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cousteau offered, "What is the origin of the devouring curiosity that drives men to commit their lives, their health, their reputation, their fortunes, to conquer a bit of knowledge, to stretch our physical, emotional or intellectual territory? The more I spend time observing nature, the more I believe that man&#x2019;s motivation for exploration is but the sophistication of a universal instinctive drive deeply ingrained in all living creatures." Morrison agreed that "it is in our nature" and that "human beings explore because in the long run . . . both by genetics and by culture, we can do nothing else."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So the last thing I would want to imply through these stories is that the best days of scientific exploration are behind us. Far from it. Several of the stories here unfolded in just the last few years. Headlines are being made on a regular basis by newly found hominid, animal, and plant fossils, and many more surprises are still buried in the earth&#x2019;s crust. Powerful new tools for mining the DNA record of life and human evolution are certain to greatly expand our knowledge of ou...</p></p><h2>A Good Food Day: Reboot Your Health with Food That Tastes Great: A Cookbook</h2><p><b>In <i>A Good Food Day</i>, more than 100 recipes made with good-for-you ingredients make a good food day--a day when feeling good and eating well go hand in hand--easy and attainable. </b><br><br>After years of thoughtless eating that led to weight gain and poor health, chef Marco Canora knew he had to make every day a <i>good </i>food day: a whole day in which every meal was full of healthy and delicious ingredients.

However, readers looking for information on Chen's personal life will not find it here. VERDICT Chen's fans and young skating enthusiasts will find much to devour about life as a competitive skater, while general memoir readers may not find much of a connection.&#x2014;Mindy Rhiger, Hennepin County Library, MN</p><h2>Awakening through the Nine Bodies: Exploring Levels of Consciousness in Meditation</h2><p>Based on meditation practices Phillip Moffitt learned twenty years ago from Himalayan yoga master Sri Swami Balyogi Premvarni, this beautifully illustrated book is a guide to exploring the nature of mind and gaining a better understanding of experiences that arise during meditation. The Nine Bodies teachings map out a journey that starts with consciousness that arises in the physical body and is directly observable, and then travels through ever more subtle levels of consciousness to that which is not manifest and is only potential, and therefore has to be inferred. The book includes a series of mysterious illustrations that Balyogi created during his time of intense Samadhi explorations. Each illustration is a rich composition of symbols that express aspects of inner experiences that are almost impossible to express with language.<br><br>Moffitt makes these teachings available for meditation students from all spiritual traditions to use as gateways for exploring the nature of mind and as additional means for tracking and classifying meditative experiences. Students of yoga will also find value in the teachings of the Nine Bodies as they provide a means for contextualizing and connecting with yogic teachings on chakras, koshas, gunas, and the Three Bodies.</p><p>Phillip Moffitt is a Buddhist meditation teacher and writer based in the San Francisco Bay Area. He has served as co-guiding teacher at Spirit Rock Meditation Center since 2010 and leads meditation retreats throughout the United States. His teacher, the Venerable Ajahn Sumedho, inspired his book on the Four Noble Truths, <i>Dancing with Life: Buddhist Insights for Finding Meaning and Joy in the Face of Suffering </i>(Rodale, 2008). <br><br>Prior to immersing himself in the study of Theravadan Buddhism, Moffitt spent over ten years studying and practicing yoga with teachers in the Sivananda and Iyengar traditions. He has written numerous articles for both Buddhist and yoga magazines and journals. <br><br> In addition to teaching meditation, Moffitt is the president of Life Balance Institute, which he founded in 1995. In his work at the institute, he trains individuals and groups in the principles of values-based leadership and living with an emphasis on how to skillfully make major transitions. His book, <i>Emotional Chaos to Clarity </i>(Penguin, 2012), presents many of the principles that he uses in Life Balance work. <br><br> Before becoming a meditation teacher and founding Life Balance Institute, Moffitt was editor-in-chief and CEO of <i>Esquire </i>and led the successful turnaround of the magazine in the 1980s.&#x201c;In this remarkable book, Phillip Moffitt presents a subtle and original description of&nbsp;the many layers of human consciousness, leading to the depths of liberating realization.&nbsp;Moffitt&#x2019;s understanding is relevant for students from both yogic and Buddhist&nbsp;backgrounds.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x2014;Guy Armstrong, author of <i>Emptiness: A Practical Guide for Meditators<br></i><br> &#x201c;How can we map the inner terrain of consciousness, locate ourselves within it, and&nbsp;even choose to travel in different dimensions to discover ever more subtle qualities&nbsp;of existence<i>?

They present an illusion of marital bliss to their conservative Sri Lankan&#x2013;American families, while each dates on the side. It&#x2019;s not ideal, but for Lucky, it seems to be working. She goes out dancing, she drinks a bit, she makes ends meet by doing digital art on commission. But when Lucky&#x2019;s grandmother has a nasty fall, Lucky returns to her childhood home and unexpectedly reconnects with her former best friend and first lover, Nisha, who is preparing for her own arranged wedding with a man she&#x2019;s never met.<br><br>As the connection between the two women is rekindled, Lucky tries to save Nisha from entering a marriage based on a lie.

Is she willing to walk away from all that she values about her parents and community to live in a new truth? As Lucky&#x2014;an outsider no matter what choices she makes&#x2014;is pushed to the breaking point, <i>Marriage of a Thousand Lies</i> offers a vivid exploration of a life lived at a complex intersection of race, sexuality, and nationality. The result is a profoundly American debut novel shot through with humor and loss, a story of love, family, and the truths that define us all.</p><p>SJ Sindu is the author of the novel <i>Marriage of a Thousand Lies</i>&nbsp;and the hybrid fiction and nonfiction chapbook <i>I Once Met You But You Were Dead</i>.

Sindu lives in Tampa and teaches at Ringling College of Art &amp; Design.When I was nine I wanted a short-sleeved button-down shirt. Amma refused to buy one from the boys&#x2019; section, pushed me instead toward the pinks and butterflies in the girls&#x2019;, so I told her I needed one for a school play. I wore it open when I biked down hills, the wind slipping its fingers through the loose weave, cooling my sweat through my tank top. My best friend Nisha told me I&#x2019;d make a cute boy, and her words squeezed something deep inside my bones, pried loose the skin between my legs. Pin pricks. Needles. My first lie.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Music pumps from the walls and jumps off the tin roof tiles. Gay night at the local dive, and it&#x2019;s a clash of rainbow shirts against walls of dusty license plates. College lesbians and blue-collar queers slide around each other in the hot, coffin-shaped bar. Hands slip numbers over sticky tables, roaming thumbs hook over edges of rough denim, drunken tongues on beads of sweat, lips mix over whispered lies, skin on skin without room for truths and this is why we&#x2019;re here.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Two o&#x2019;clock,&#x201d; Kris says. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t look.&#x201d; He leans my way over a tall, spindly table and sips his long island iced tea through a stirrer held between his teeth. His hair, which he grows out into a swoop over his left eye, falls down between us like a curtain. We&#x2019;ve both taken off our wedding rings. Mine rests in a tiny glass tray in our bathroom. Kris&#x2019;s is placed carefully on his nightstand next to his multivitamins.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The walls vibrate with the bass, bouncing across my skin. I drink my beer and check my phone, wondering if it&#x2019;s my ex calling, but it&#x2019;s only my mother.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Your two o&#x2019;clock, or mine?&#x201d; I say.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Mine.&#x201d; Kris shakes the hair out of his eyes and points at my phone. &#x201c;Is it Emily?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;No.&#x201d; I put my phone back in my pocket. It&#x2019;s only been a couple of weeks since Emily and I broke up, but the time has stretched me out. My insides feel ragged and thin. I want the dance floor to swell up with people, the music to climb inside me and wipe my brain clean.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kris stares hard at his glass, now mostly filled with ice, the dark tea slurped down to the last inch. Even at twenty-seven, he is still all angles that push at his clothing.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I drain the last of my beer and walk toward the bar. Kris&#x2019;s two o&#x2019;clock is a man sitting at the table next to ours in a Red Sox hat and a white Hanes shirt. He holds his Bud Light to his lips but doesn&#x2019;t drink.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I walk up next to a woman on a bar stool whose sad eyes droop down at the outer corners like they&#x2019;re going to tip the pupils right out of her face. My phone buzzes. I ignore it. The woman smiles at me, her mouth edged in red lipstick. I could take her into a bathroom stall and push her up against the cold brick walls. I think of that red, red mouth gaping open, lipstick smeared, fingers clutching at me, lips slippery on my fingers and mouth.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I smile back. She slides her bar stool closer and touches my arm when she talks, her fingers tingling the skin where I&#x2019;ve pushed up the sleeves of my button-down. Kris would say it was worth it. A fuck&#x2019;s a fuck, he would say.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My phone buzzes. Amma again. I leave the woman smiling and walk back to where Kris is standing, stirring the ice in his glass around and around. This is the first time we&#x2019;ve gone out in months&#x2014;my unemployment and his busy work schedule as a second-pass message editor for a greeting card company keeps us out of the bars and at home doing normal married people things like Amma always wanted. Kris spends his nights trying to write his own greetings and staring at the cards framed over his desk, the few he got published when he first left engineering and started in this business. I spend my nights drawing commissions for horny suburban fanboys with money to waste&#x2014;too-thin elves facing off against tentacled monsters, custom Sailor Scouts, coy anime girls frolicking at the beach, well-endowed geishas undressing in dimly-lit rooms.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;So?&#x201d; Kris says. He tips his glass back and shakes an ice cube into his mouth.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;The one at the bar? I don&#x2019;t think so.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;A fuck&#x2019;s a fuck.&#x201d; He holds the ice cube between his teeth and talks around it. &#x201c;Emily&#x2019;s getting laid. Why shouldn&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Shut up.&#x201d; I wish I had bought another beer so that I&#x2019;d have something to hold onto, so that the cold of it could take my mind off the ache in my stomach. My hands grasp at the air.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The man in the Red Sox hat stares hard at Kris through the darkness of the bar.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Emily was no Nisha,&#x201d; Kris says. He raises his empty glass. &#x201c;To Nisha, your oldest and truest.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I feel the outline of my phone through my pocket and think about calling Nisha.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Red Sox Hat seems interested,&#x201d; I say.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;He&#x2019;s drinking a Bud Light.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;A fuck&#x2019;s a fuck.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I haven&#x2019;t spoken to Nisha since my wedding, haven&#x2019;t had a meaningful conversation with her since we graduated from high school four years before that. I tap my fingers on the table. What would she say if I called her now?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;He&#x2019;s not bad looking.&#x201d; Kris tucks a piece of hair behind his ear and looks again at the man, letting his gaze linger. He crunches down on another ice cube. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s coming over.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Red Sox Hat puts his enormous biceps on our table, which creaks under the pressure. He&#x2019;s younger-looking close up, probably still in his early twenties, still in college. Kris sits up a bit straighter.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The man smirks at me and says, &#x201c;Can I buy you a drink?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before I can react, Kris reaches across the table and folds his fingers over my wrist. My phone buzzes.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;This one&#x2019;s mine,&#x201d; Kris says.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Red Sox Hat gets up off the table and looks from Kris to me and back to Kris. &#x201c;My mistake.&#x201d; He walks back to his table.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wrench myself from Kris&#x2019;s grip. He puts his forehead in his hands.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Sorry,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;I thought he was looking at you.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kris nods to the table. I rub my wrist where he held it. We have an agreement that he&#x2019;ll intervene if guys hit on me, but he overdoes it.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I knew these boots were a bad idea,&#x201d; I say. Kris had picked them out. &#x201c;I look straight.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;How&#x2019;s this for a greeting? Roses are red, violets are blue.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Is now really the time?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Every guy I like just wants to sleep with you.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Wonderful. You should write greetings for a living.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kris lifts his head up and catches my eye. We laugh at the same time. Our heads tip toward each other and we clutch the table for support. Some of the thinness inside me fades. I feel almost solid.</p><h2>The Art of Modern Quilling: Contemporary Paper Techniques &amp; Projects for Captivating Quilled Designs</h2><p><b><i>The Art of Modern Quilling </i>breathes new life into a&nbsp;time-tested&nbsp;craft with innovative&nbsp;instruction and creative projects you will love to make and wear!</b><br><br> Colorful strips of paper and a few simple tools are all you need to create an infinite number of amazing projects with author and quilling expert extraordinaire&nbsp;Erin Curet!

Epileptic gathers together and makes available in English for the first time all six volumes of the internationally acclaimed graphic work.<br><br>David B. was born Pierre-Fran�ois Beauchard in a small town near Orl�ans, France. He spent an idyllic early childhood playing with the neighborhood kids and, along with his older brother, Jean-Christophe, ganging up on his little sister, Florence. But their lives changed abruptly when Jean-Christophe was struck with epilepsy at age eleven. In search of a cure, their parents dragged the family to acupuncturists and magnetic therapists, to mediums and macrobiotic communes. But every new cure ended in disappointment as Jean-Christophe, after brief periods of remission, would only get worse.<br><br>Angry at his brother for abandoning him and at all the quacks who offered them false hope, Pierre-Fran�ois learned to cope by drawing fantastically elaborate battle scenes, creating images that provide a fascinating window into his interior life. An honest and horrifying portrait of the disease and of the pain and fear it sowed in the family, Epileptic is also a moving depiction of one family&#x2019;s intricate history. Through flashbacks, we are introduced to the stories of Pierre-Fran�ois&#x2019;s grandparents and we relive his grandfathers&#x2019; experiences in both World Wars. We follow Pierre-Fran�ois through his childhood, adolescence, and adulthood, all the while charting his complicated relationship with his brother and Jean-Christophe&#x201d;s losing battle with epilepsy. Illustrated with beautiful and striking black-and-white images, Epileptic is as astonishing, intimate, and heartbreaking as the best literary memoir.</p><p>"David B has created a wildly beautiful fantasia on human frailty, on the making of an artist and the unmaking of his own brother -- a memoir that is hopeful and bitterly poignant all at once." -- Paul Collins, author of <i>Not Even Wrong: Adventures in Autism<br></i>David B. is a founding member of L&#x2019;Association, a group of French cartoonists who banded together as publishers in 1990 and have revolutionized European comics with their groundbreaking approach to format, subject matter, and style.

The roots of Peabody&#39;s book came from Boston&#39;s Emmanuel Church where clergy and lay practitioners reported success in treating alcoholics. However, Peabody&#39;s book is a secular treatment of the problem using psychology. The book was a best seller in the early 1930&#39;s and had a major influence on Alcoholics Anonymous founder Bill Wilson. The book&#39;s methods for the &#34;cure&#34; of alchoholism are as relevant today as they were in the 1930&#39;s. (All profits from this book are donated to programs for &#34;at Risk&#34; children.)</p><p>Richard R. Peabody 1892--1936 Richard R. Peabody was afflicted with alcoholism in young adulthood, which was exacerbated by his wartime experiences. He had served as a Captain in the United States Army&#39;s 15th Field Artillery, 2nd Division, AEF, during World War I. His disease led to the disolution of his marriage. He became a disciple of the Emmanuel Movement, named for Boston&#39;s Emmanuel Church where clergy and lay practitioners reported success in treating alcoholics. He wrote &#34;The Common Sense of Drinking,&#34; published by Little Brown in 1931, and reprinted in 1933, in which he was the first to state there was no cure for alcoholism. The book was a best seller and had a major influence on Alcoholics Anonymous founder Bill Wilson. Peabody continued to treat alcoholics though he was neither a medical professional nor a psychologist.</p><h2>Blood, Fire, Death: The Swedish Metal Story (Extreme Metal)</h2><p>In the early 1990s, Swedish death metal revolutionized the international music scene. Suddenly, the mild-mannered Scandinavian country found itself at the forefront of a new movement with worldwide impact thanks to bands such as Entombed, Dismember, and At the Gates. The birth of black metal drove the culture to even greater extremes, featuring a rawer, darker sound and non-ironic death-worship. Soon churches in both Norway and Sweden were aflame, and be- fore long Satanism emerged as more than just an image. But how did it all start? Why did Sweden become a hotbed for such aggressive, nihilistic music? And who are the people and bands that brought it all about?<br><em>Blood, Fire, Death: A Swedish Metal Story </em>recounts the evolution of the genre from the massive amplifier walls of 1970s rock, through the church-burning Satanic 1990s, to the diverse and paradoxical manifestations of the scene today. This book focuses on the phenomena that have propelled the scene forward in an evolution that has not only been musical, but aesthetic and ideological as well. This is a story about grotesque logos and icons that invoke death and darkness, but also a story of dedication, friendship, community, and a profound love for music.</p><p>This is not the definitive history of Swedish metal. Instead we&#x2019;ve focused on bands, individuals and phenomena which to various extents have propelled the scene forward. This evolution has not only been musical, but aesthetic and at times ideological. <i>Blood, Fire, Death</i> investigates the politics, economy and gender structures of the scene. This is a story of grotesque logos and icons, about real death and darkness, but also a story of dedication, friendship, community &#x2014; and a profound love for music.Ika Johannesson has been one of Sweden&#x2019;s major music journalists for the last 20 years.

Even though he had hosted the Prophecy Club radio program for 25 years, he freely admits he knew NOTHING of what was revealed to him supernaturally now found in this book. One prophetic word said, &#34;There is a lock that I have put over a word in the Book of Revelation that I am going to open unto you.

Pain must ultimately be pleasurable. And any sort of masochism or sadism must work in the context of pleasing the sub.</b></p> <p>In BDSM culture, it seems relatively easy to get the hang of the attitude, the behavior and the words. But in terms of logistics, as in how to properly discipline or punish a sub, things do get a bit more complicated. </p> <p>And that&#x2019;s why we&#x2019;re devoting this entire book on <b>how to play right</b> and how to punish the sub so that she likes it, rather than the Dom abusing her and violating trust&#x2014;the ultimate sin in the game of discipline.</p> <p>We&#x2019;re also going to cover some of the more &#x201c;fringe&#x201d; topics of BDSM, including <b>health risks, extreme pain, unique psychological states and how you as a sub can protect yourself.</b> This will be of crucial interest to you as a sub or switch or Dom, since it&#x2019;s best to understand the logistics and motivations of both roles before you fully submit.</p> <p>You may also discover that as you take precautions and grow in knowledge, more extreme practices may appeal to you. At the very least, you will always know what a Dom means by some of these code words and what they imply sexually or in punishment. It&#x2019;s always a good idea to stay informed and never take chances&#x2014;never assume anything! Because in BDSM, assuming anything of your Dom can be a big mistake.</p> <p>To get truly healthy and pleasurable BDSM experience, these are the topics you surely don't want to miss!</p></p><p></p><h2>Psychodynamic Counselling in Action (Counselling in Action Series)</h2><p>This substantially revised fifth edition of a classic text includes an updated preface, new content on the therapeutic relationship, substantially revised chapters on the middle phase of counselling and reflections on the influence of other modalities and shared aspects of practice across approaches.

There has been an increasing emphasis on the importance of reading comprehension in recent years but despite this there is very little written on this vital topic accessible to trainee and practicing teachers. </p> <p></p> <p>The <em>Handbook of Reading Comprehension</em> presents an overview of recent findings on reading comprehension and comprehension problems in children. It provides a detailed examination of the characteristics of children who have reading comprehension difficulties, and examines ways in which comprehension can be supported and improved. It is accessibly written for students and professionals with no previous background in the psychology of reading or reading problems. </p> <p></p> <p>This indispensable handbook asks the question &#x2018;what is comprehension?&#x2019; The authors consider comprehension of different units of language: understanding single words, sentences, and connected prose and outline what readers (and listeners) have to do to successfully understand an extended text. This book also considers comprehension for different purposes, in particular reading for pleasure and reading to learn and explores how reader characteristics such as interest and motivation can influence the comprehension process. </p> <p></p> <p>Different skills contribute to successful reading comprehension. These include word reading ability, vocabulary knowledge, syntactic skills, memory, and discourse level skills such as the ability to make inferences, knowledge about text structure, and metacognitive skills. The authors discuss how each one contributes to the development of reading comprehension skill and how the development of these skills (or their precursors) in pre-readers, provides the foundation for reading comprehension development. </p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Areas covered include:-</p> <p></p> <ul> <p> </p><li>Word reading and comprehension</li> <p></p> <p> </p><li>Development of comprehension skills</li> <p></p> <p> </p><li>Comprehension difficulties</li> <p></p> <p> </p><li>Assessment</li> <p></p> <p> </p><li>Teaching for improvement</li> <p></p></ul> <p>Throughout the text successful experimental and classroom based interventions will be highlighted, practical tips for teachers and summary boxes detailing key points and explaining technical terms will be included in each chapter </p></p><p>Kate Cain, DPhil, is a Reader in the Department of Psychology at Lancaster University. Her research and publications focus on the development of language comprehension in children, with a particular interest in the skill deficits that lead to comprehension problems. Dr. Cain's recent journal articles report investigations into the relations that exist between children's reading comprehension and their inference-making skill, knowledge of narrative structure, interpretation of figurative language, vocabulary-learning mechanisms, and memory processes.

These diseases are modern mismatch diseases created by our brains attempting to function in the presence of a chemical monster at levels not experienced during the brain&#x2019;s evolution. This book describes specific preventative measures to be taken by you and your family to rid yourself of this chemical monster. Most importantly a preventative system for individuals is described in this book involving 7 specific supplements, 7 lifestyle choices, and a dissolved mineral that will prevent Alzheimer&#x2019;s, autism, and stroke.&nbsp; This is also a combination therapy that has been shown to reverse the cognitive decline seen in early-stage Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease.&nbsp; Elements of this combination therapy have also been found to reverse the course of autism in the very young and the course of hardening of the arteries and stroke in the very old.</p> <p>The author&#x2019;s interest in dementia started after an acquaintance died of the after-effects of a stroke and the author&#x2019;s mother and a friend&#x2019;s mother, both 86 years old at the time, began suffering severe frustration and panic attacks due to short term memory failure.&nbsp; With a doctorate in chemistry from Harvard, the author spent a number of years reading hundreds of research articles in scientific journals. The search for the causes of Alzheimer&#x2019;s and stroke started as a mystery and led to a surprising connection with autism. Once the mystery was solved it transformed into a crusade.&nbsp; The author found this monster lurking in his medicine cabinet, food pantries, refrigerator, and the water pipes leading into his home.&nbsp;&nbsp; This monster had been damaging the brains of newborn infants, elderly family members, and everyone in between for years.</p>&nbsp; <p>Alzheimer&#x2019;s (AD) is a currently a terminal disease but it is not an inevitable part of aging.&nbsp; The United States has a death rate due to Alzheimer&#x2019;s that is one of the highest in the world (24.8 per 100,000) while Singapore has one of the lowest death rates due to Alzheimer&#x2019;s (0 per 100,000). This is in spite of the fact that people in Singapore live on average 4 years longer than people in the United States.</p> <p>Therefore AD is not a typical part of ageing as there are countries in the world, such as Singapore, where people with a life expectancy greater than the U.S. have much less AD.&nbsp;&nbsp; Surprisingly these same countries also have much lower incidence of autism. This book explains why AD and autism are not prevalent in some parts of the world and how countries, like the U.S., can take steps to lower their rates of both AD and autism.</p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>This book makes it clear that as both individuals and as a culture it is time to take on neurotoxic aluminum that causes AD, autism, and stroke. Reading this book will allow you to make an informed decision about what recommendations you will use to prevent neurotoxic aluminum from claiming your brain and the brains of those you love.</p> <p>By using recent research to identify neurotoxic forms of aluminum as a cause of Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease and providing steps to avoid aluminum ingestion, this book provides a different perspective from other books on Alzheimer&#x2019;s prevention by notable authors such as Jean Carper, Bruce File and Russel Blaylock, Gary Small and Gigi Vorgan, and Thomas Harding.</p></p><p><p>Of all the books I read in college, the three most significant in shaping my career were: &#x201c;Silent Spring&#x201d; by Rachel Carson, &#x201c;The Fitness of the Environment&#x201d; by L. J. Henderson and &#x201c;The Immense Journey&#x201d; by Loren C. Eiseley. These books describe how our planet evolved to become an ideal environment for life and how our species, Homo sapiens, evolved to unwittingly upset this environment by introducing chemicals, such as DDT and aluminum.</p> <p>After graduating from college I co-founded a company to analyze the chemicals in food and water. In less than a year the company became the only one in New England approved by the FDA to analyze meat products for toxic chemicals, such as PCB&#x2019;s and pesticides. The company tested and approved these products for sale to the public.</p><p></p> <p>With my two business partners, I later purchased a company that produced isotopically labeled chemicals. With the help of a group of talented chemists, I developed a series of stable isotopically labelled toxic chemicals and pesticides that were sold and used worldwide for quantifying these chemicals in food and water.</p> <p>I developed the first computerized instruments to measure the corrosion rate of metals in contact with liquids. These rates are important when storing food and water in metal containers for long periods of time. These rates become even more important when cooking food in contact with metal surfaces, since heat usually increases the rate of metal corrosion.</p> <p>Working with a dedicated group of people, I helped develop a new type of detector for toxic and flammable gases. Thousands of these detectors were manufactured and are currently used by gas utility leak technicians for finding toxic and flammable gas leaks in homes.</p> <p>Since 2012 I have taken courses at the University of Tasmania on dementia and at Harvard on neurochemistry along with studying the scientific literature relating to the neurochemistry of the brain. This book is the result of this study.</p></p><h2>Daily Spellbook for the Good Witch: Quick, Simple, and Practical Magic for Every Day of the Year</h2><p><b>Practical magic for every day and every season!</b><br>Everybody has something they&#x2019;d like to change, be it love, career, friendships, health, or money.

Surrounded by men and women whose skills&#x2013;as doctors, nurses, and therapists&#x2013;seemed eminently more practical than her own, Rodriguez, a hairdresser and mother of two from Michigan, despaired of being of any real use. Yet she soon found she had a gift for befriending Afghans, and once her profession became known she was eagerly sought out by Westerners desperate for a good haircut and by Afghan women, who have a long and proud tradition of running their own beauty salons. Thus an idea was born. <br><br>With the help of corporate and international sponsors, the Kabul Beauty School welcomed its first class in 2003. Well meaning but sometimes brazen, Rodriguez stumbled through language barriers, overstepped cultural customs, and constantly juggled the challenges of a postwar nation even as she learned how to empower her students to become their families&#x2019; breadwinners by learning the fundamentals of coloring techniques, haircutting, and makeup.<br><br>Yet within the small haven of the beauty school, the line between teacher and student quickly blurred as these vibrant women shared with Rodriguez their stories and their hearts: the newlywed who faked her virginity on her wedding night, the twelve-year-old bride sold into marriage to pay her family&#x2019;s debts, the Taliban member&#x2019;s wife who pursued her training despite her husband&#x2019;s constant beatings. Through these and other stories, Rodriguez found the strength to leave her own unhealthy marriage and allow herself to love again, Afghan style.<br><br>With warmth and humor, Rodriguez details the lushness of a seemingly desolate region and reveals the magnificence behind the burqa. <i>Kabul Beauty School </i>is a remarkable tale of an extraordinary community of women who come together and learn the arts of perms, friendship, and freedom.</p><p>Deborah Rodriguez has been as a hairdresser since 1979, except for one brief stint when she worked as a corrections officer in her hometown of Holland, Michigan. She currently directs the Kabul Beauty School, the first modern beauty academy and training salon in Afghanistan. Rodriguez also owns the Oasis Salon and the Cabul Coffee House. She lives in Kabul with her Afghan husband.Chapter 1<br><br>The women arrive at the salon just before eight in the morning. If it were any other day, I&#x2019;d still be in bed, trying to sink into a few more minutes of sleep. I&#x2019;d probably still be cursing the neighbor&#x2019;s rooster for waking me up again at dawn. I might even still be groaning about the vegetable dealers who come down the street at three in the morning with their noisy, horse-drawn wagons, or the neighborhood mullah, who warbles out his long, mournful call to prayer at four-thirty. But this is the day of Roshanna&#x2019;s engagement party, so I&#x2019;m dressed and ready for work. I&#x2019;ve already had four cigarettes and two cups of instant coffee, which I had to make by myself because the cook has not yet arrived. This is more of a trial than you might think, since I&#x2019;ve barely learned how to boil water in Afghanistan. When I have to do it myself, I put a lit wooden match on each of the burners of the cranky old gas stove, turn one of the knobs, and back off to see which of the burners explodes into flame. Then I settle a pot of water there and pray that whatever bacteria are floating in the Kabul water today are killed by the boiling.<br><br>The mother-in-law comes into the salon first, and we exchange the traditional Afghan greeting: we clasp hands and kiss each other&#x2019;s cheeks three times. Roshanna is behind her, a tiny, awkward, blue ghost wearing the traditional burqa that covers her, head to toe, with only a small piece of netting for her to see out the front. But the netting has been pulled crooked, across her nose, and she bumps into the doorway. She laughs and flutters her arms inside the billowing fabric, and two of her sisters-in-law help her navigate her way through the door. Once inside, Roshanna snatches the burqa off and drapes it over the top of one of the hair dryers.<br><br>&#x201c;This was like Taliban days again,&#x201d; she cries, because she hasn&#x2019;t worn the burqa since the Taliban were driven out of Kabul in the fall of 2001. Roshanna usually wears clothes that she sews herself&#x2014; brilliant shalwar kameezes or saris in shades of orchid and peach, lime green and peacock blue. Roshanna usually stands out like a butterfly against the gray dustiness of Kabul and even against the other women on the streets, in their mostly drab, dark clothing. But today she observes the traditional behavior of a bride on the day of her engagement party or wedding. She has left her parents&#x2019; house under cover of burqa and will emerge six hours later wearing her body weight in eye shadow, false eyelashes the size of sparrows, monumentally big hair, and clothes with more bling than a Ferris wheel. In America, most people would associate this look with drag queens sashaying off to a party with a 1950s prom theme. Here in Afghanistan, for reasons I still don&#x2019;t understand, this look conveys the mystique of the virgin.<br><br>The cook arrives just behind the women, whispering that she&#x2019;ll make the tea, and Topekai, Baseera, and Bahar, the other beauticians, rush into the salon and take off their head scarves. Then we begin the joyful, gossipy, daylong ordeal of transforming twenty-year-old Roshanna into a traditional Afghan bride. Most salons would charge up to $250&#x2014;about half the annual income for a typical Afghan&#x2014;for the bride&#x2019;s services alone. But I am not only Roshanna&#x2019;s former teacher but also her best friend, even though I&#x2019;m more than twenty years older. She is my first and best friend in Afghanistan. I love her dearly, so the salon services are just one of my gifts to her.<br><br>We begin with the parts of Roshanna that no one will see tonight except her husband. Traditional Afghans consider body hair to be both ugly and unclean, so she must be stripped of all of it except for the long, silky brown hair on her head and her eyebrows. There can be no hair left on her arms, underarms, face, or privates. Her body must be as soft and hairless as that of a prepubescent girl. We lead Roshanna down the corridor to the waxing room&#x2014;the only one in Afghanistan, I might add&#x2014;and she grimaces as she sits down on the bed.<br><br>&#x201c;You could have done it yourself at home,&#x201d; I tease her, and the others laugh. Many brides are either too modest or too fearful to have their pubic hair removed by others in a salon, so they do it at home&#x2014;they either pull it out by hand or rip it out with chewing gum. Either way, the process is brutally painful. Besides, it&#x2019;s hard to achieve the full Brazilian&#x2014;every pubic hair plucked, front and back&#x2014; when you do it on your own, even if you&#x2019;re one of the few women in this country to own a large mirror, as Roshanna does.<br><br>&#x201c;At least you know your husband is somewhere doing this, too,&#x201d; Topekai says with a leer. My girls giggle at this reference to the groom&#x2019;s attention to his own naked body today. He also must remove all of his body hair.<br><br>&#x201c;But he only has to shave it off!&#x201d; Roshanna wails, then blushes and looks down. I know she doesn&#x2019;t want to appear critical of her new husband, whom she hasn&#x2019;t yet met, in front of her mother-in-law. She doesn&#x2019;t want to give the older woman any reason to find fault with her, and when Roshanna looks back up again, she smiles at me anxiously.<br><br>But the mother-in-law seems not to have heard her. She has been whispering outside the door with one of her daughters. When she turns her attention back to the waxing room, she looks at Roshanna with a proud, proprietary air.<br><br>The mother-in-law had picked Roshanna out for her son a little more than a year after Roshanna graduated from the first class at the Kabul Beauty School, in the fall of 2003, and opened her own salon. The woman was a distant cousin who came in for a perm. She admired this pretty, plucky, resourceful girl who had been supporting her parents and the rest of her family ever since they fled into Pakistan to escape the Taliban. After she left Roshanna&#x2019;s salon, she started asking around for further details about the girl. She liked what she heard.<br><br>Roshanna&#x2019;s father had been a doctor, and the family had led a privileged life until they fled to Pakistan in 1998. There, he was not allowed to practice medicine&#x2014;a typical refugee story&#x2014;and had to work as a lowly shoeshine man. By the time they returned to Kabul, he was in such ill health that he couldn&#x2019;t practice medicine. Still,<br><br>he staunchly carried out his fatherly duties by accompanying Roshanna everywhere to watch over her. The mother-in-law had detected no whiff of scandal about Roshanna, except perhaps her friendship with me. Even that didn&#x2019;t put her off, since foreign women are not held to the same rigorous standards as Afghan women. We are like another gender entirely, able to wander back and forth between the two otherwise separate worlds of men and women; when we do something outrageous, like reach out to shake a man&#x2019;s hand, it&#x2019;s usually a forgivable and expected outrage. The mother-in-law may even have regarded me as an asset, a connection to the wealth and power of America, as nearly all Afghans assume Americans are rich. And we are, all of us, at least in a material sense. Anyway, the mother-in-law was determined to secure Roshanna as the first wife for her elder son, an engineer living in Amsterdam. There was nothing unusual about this. Nearly all first marriages in Afghanistan are arranged, and it usually falls to the man&#x2019;s mother to select the right girl for him. He may take on a second or even third wife later on, but that first virginal lamb is almost as much his mother&#x2019;s as his.<br><br>I see that Roshanna is faltering under her mother-in-law&#x2019;s gaze, and I pull all the other women away from the waxing room. &#x201c;How about highlights today?&#x201d; I ask the mother-in-law. &#x201c;My girls do foiling better than anyone between here and New York City.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Better than in Dubai?&#x201d; the mother-in-law asks.<br><br>&#x201c;Better than in Dubai,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;And a lot cheaper.&#x201d;<br><br>Back in the main room of the salon, I make sure the curtains are pulled tight so that no passing male can peek in to see the women bareheaded. That&#x2019;s the kind of thing that could get my salon and the Kabul Beauty School itself closed down. I light candles so that we can turn the overhead lights off. With all the power needed for the machine that melts the wax, the facial lamps, the blow dryers, and the other salon appliances, I don&#x2019;t want to blow a fuse. I put on a CD of Christmas carols. It&#x2019;s the only one I can find, and they won&#x2019;t know the difference anyway. Then I settle the mother-in-law and the members of the bridal party into their respective places, one for a manicure, one for a pedicure, one to get her hair washed. I make sure they all have tea and the latest outdated fashion magazines from the States, then excuse myself with a cigarette. I usually just go ahead and smoke in the salon, but the look on Roshanna&#x2019;s face just before I shut the door to the waxing room has my heart racing. Because she has a terrible secret, and I&#x2019;m the only one who knows it&#x2014;for now.<br><br>both engagement parties and weddings are lavish events in Afghanistan. Families save money for years and even take on huge debt to make these events as festive as possible, sparing no expense. After all, this is a country with virtually no public party life. There are no nightclubs, no concerts, only a few restaurants&#x2014;and the ones that have opened since the Taliban left are frequented mostly by Westerners. There are a few movie theaters, but it&#x2019;s primarily men who go to them. If a woman happens to show up, as I once did when I insisted that a male friend take me, then she becomes the show, with every turban in the room turned her way so that the men can gawk at her. There are just about no venues where Afghan men and women dress up and mingle. They don&#x2019;t exactly mingle at engagement parties and weddings, either. At big gatherings, the hundreds of men and women are segregated on two different floors of the hall with two different bands; at smaller gatherings, they are on one floor but separated by a curtain. In both cases, they dress to the nines. When I first came to Kabul, I was amazed by all the stores that sell wedding gowns. There are probably two on every block. Full-size mannequins are lined up in the windows of these stores, heads tilted at a haughty angle, overlooking the street in their colorful dresses spangled with rhinestones and swathed in tulle. They look like giant Barbie dolls&#x2014; all very tall and Caucasian-looking&#x2014;and when I was first here, I memorized the dolls in the windows so I could find my way back to my guesthouse. I pretended that they were guiding me home.<br><br>Roshanna&#x2019;s parents shook their heads and declined when the groom&#x2019;s mother first came calling with cakes and imported candies and other gifts to ask for her hand, but they were pleased with the offer. Saying no was only part of the ritual, a way of signaling that their daughter was so precious and beloved that they hated to let her leave the family home. It was also the first step in a bargaining process. For the next few months, the fathers haggled over the size of her cash dowry, over the number of dresses the groom&#x2019;s family would have their tailor make for her and the amount of fabric they&#x2019;d give her family so they could make their own new clothes, over the value of the gold jewelry the groom&#x2019;s family would give Roshanna. Her father had negotiated all this well. The cash dowry that would be paid to her family was ten thousand dollars, and she would receive five thousand dollars in gold as well as many other accoutrements of an upper-class wedding. Roshanna was not consulted about any of this. As with all first marriages in Afghanistan, it was strictly business, a transaction enacted between fathers. But she was eager to be married. In fact, she&#x2019;s one of the only brides I&#x2019;ve ever met in Kabul who actually wanted to get married.<br><br>from the moment that I met Roshanna during my first visit to Kabul in the spring of 2002, the first spring after the rout of the Taliban, I puzzled over the sadness in her. Why did I respond so strongly to her sadness when there are millions of sad stories in Kabul? It&#x2019;s a city that&#x2019;s dense with sadness. There are so many people who lost loved ones in the twenty-seven years of war in Afghanistan, who have lost homes and livelihoods, who have lost entire towns and families, who have lost every dream they ever had. And there is still the occasional bombing or surprise mine explosion that rips away the happiness people finally think might be theirs. So why did Roshanna stand out amid all that sadness? I think it was her gaiety, her warmth and exuberance, her colorful clothes and bright smile. She was trying so hard to be happy that it hurt me when her sadness showed.<br><br>It had taken a few weeks for her to tell me her story. I had noticed that she seemed to light up when a certain young man came into the building where she was a secretary and I was a volunteer with a nonprofit organization. At first, I thought she might be sad because he wasn&#x2019;t interested in her, but then I thought I saw the same light in his face when he caught sight of her from across the room. I started to tease her about it.<br><br>&#x201c;Got a boyfriend?&#x201d; I&#x2019;d whisper, and she&#x2019;d blush and turn away.<br><br>&#x201c;We don&#x2019;t marry for love here,&#x201d; she told me after I had teased her a few times. &#x201c;I have to marry the man my parents pick.&#x201d;<br><br>I knew that Roshanna and the boy couldn&#x2019;t admit their feelings or be obvious about them&#x2014;they couldn&#x2019;t do a damn thing about them, in fact, because there isn&#x2019;t any dating in Kabul. But I thought that maybe his mother could talk to her mother and a match could be made that began with love. My mind started to race ahead with the possibilities. Which I mentioned to her one day, but she pulled me into a dark hallway.<br><br>&#x201c;It can&#x2019;t happen, Debbie,&#x201d; she said, her eyes glistening in the faint light. &#x201c;I was engaged once to someone else. This boy&#x2019;s parents would never let him marry me.&#x201d;<br><br>I slumped against the wall. &#x201c;Why is it a problem if you were engaged before? Aren&#x2019;t you allowed to change your mind?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t understand,&#x201d; she insisted. &#x201c;We signed the nika-khat at the engagement party.&#x201d;<br><br>This other, almost-marriage had taken place when the Taliban were still in power. Her family was living the miserable life of refugees in a camp just over the border in Pakistan. Roshanna was then sixteen years old and so bright that she&#x2019;d actually found opportunities to get ahead in the camp. She learned English and some computer skills, and then found a job as a secretary with an international aid agency. She often had to cross back into Afghanistan&#x2014;accompanied by her father, of course&#x2014;to do some work for the agency.</p><h2>The Alamo (I, Q)</h2><p>Fresh off a &#34;too close&#34; encounter with the terrorist group, the Ghost Cell, in Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, Q and Angela head to San Antonio, Texas.

The Old Testament is filled with stories: Noah and the ark, Daniel in the lions' den, Ruth and Boaz&#x2014;stories of great men and women of God.<br><br>What does God want us to learn from these stories? Is there more to them than meets the eye? Richard L. Pratt says yes, and he carefully outlines a method for grasping the wisdom of these ageless narratives. Beginning with the role of the Holy Spirit, he sets forth a three-step process of biblical interpretation:<br>&#x2013;Preparation<br>&#x2013;Investigation<br>&#x2013;Application<br><br>Pratt is sensitive to the needs of both the beginner and the theological student. He insightfully guides us through considerations of attitudes and orientation, language and history, writers and characters, scenes and events, ancient and modern cultures, and more.</p><p><b>Richard L. Pratt Jr.</b> (MDiv, Union Theological Seminary; ThD, Harvard University) is president of Third Millennium Ministries. He was a professor at Reformed Theological Seminary for over twenty years and is the author of <i>Pray with Your Eyes Open</i>, <i>He Gave Us Stories</i>, and <i>Every Thought Captive</i>."This book will revolutionize your thinking about the Old Testament. It will make your personal reading of the Old Testament a joyous experience of discovery. If you are a preacher or a teacher, it will transform a dull sermon or lesson into a message that will change lives. Here is a book you don't want to miss." --<b>Steve Brown</b>, President, Key Life Network<br><br>"The stories of the Old Testament . . . thrill the imagination, but what do they have to do with us? Richard Pratt's <i>He Gave Us Stories</i> is a readable, yet profound answer to that question." --<b>Tremper Longman III</b>, Westminster Theological Seminary, Philadelphia</p><h2>Seldom Disappointed: A Memoir</h2><p><p>In this affectionate and unvarnished recollection of his past, Tony Hillerman looks at seventy-six years spent getting from hard-times farm boy to bestselling author. Using the gifts of a talented novelist and reporter, Hillerman draws brilliant portrait not just of his life, but of the world around him.</p></p><p><p>TONY HILLERMAN served as president of the Mystery Writers of America and received the Edgar and Grand Master Awards. His other honors include the Center for the American Indian&#x2019;s Ambassador Award, the Spur Award for Best Western Novel, and the Navajo Tribal Council Special Friend of the Dineh award. A native of Oklahoma, Tony Hillerman lived in Albuquerque, New Mexico, until his death in 2008.</p>What a privilege to have one of the most popular American novelists read us his memoirs while offering a look into the sources from which characters such as Joe Leaphorn and Jim Chee emerged. Tony Hillerman reads without haste, allowing us lots of time to savor memories we may not share with him, but feelings we do. His warm and avuncular voice gives just the right delivery to his subtle humor and reveals a side of his personality not found in his mystery novels. No anecdote is better than that of the first book agent, who told him, "Fine, but leave out the Indian stuff." Although this is highly recommended as a family book, young readers will underestimate the valuable wisdom being imparted.

A reference work in mysticism practice and occult study, Cosmo Conception provides the fundamentals of Esoteric Christianity from a Rosicrucian perspective.</p><p><b>About the Author:</b> <br><br>"Max Heindel - born Carl Louis von Grasshoff in Aarhus, Denmark on July 23, 1865 - was a Christian occultist, astrologer, and mystic. He died on January 6, 1919 at Oceanside, California, United States.<br><br>He was born of the royal family of Von Grasshoffs, who were connected with the German Court during the lifetime of Prince Bismark. The father of Max Heindel, Francois L. von Grasshoff, migrated, when quite a young man, to Copenhagen, Denmark, where he married a Danish woman of noble birth. They had two sons and one daughter. The oldest of these sons was Carl Louis Von Grasshoff, who later adopted the pen name of Max Heindel. The father died when the eldest son was six years of age, leaving the mother with her three small children in very straitened circumstances. His infancy was lived in genteel poverty. His mother's self-denial was carried to an extreme in order that the small income would suffice that her sons and daughter could have private tutors so that they might take their place in society as members of nobility.<br><br>At the age of sixteen years, refusing a foreseeable future among the nobility class, he left home to enter the ship-yards at Glasgow, Scotland in order to learn the engineering profession. He was soon chosen as Chief Engineer of a trading steamer, position which took him in trips all over the world and gave him a great deal of knowledge of the world and its people. For a number of years he was Chief Engineer on one of the large passenger steamers of the Cunard Line plying between America and Europe. From 1895 to 1901, he was an ill luck consulting engineer in New York City and during this time he married, the marriage being terminated by the death of his wife in 1905. A son and two daughters were born of this marriage.<br><br>In 1903, Max Heindel moved to Los Angeles, California, in order to look for a job. Meanwhile, due to his earlier years that had been full of sorrow and to sad events in his own life, an increasingly intense desire to understand the cause of the sorrows and sufferings of humanity began to grow within him, as well as a desire to help alleviate them. Giving a new course to his life, he became interested in the study of metaphysics and, after attending lectures by the theosophist C.W. Leadbeater, he joined the Theosophical Society of Los Angeles, of which he was ..." <i>(Quote from wikipedia.org)</i></p><h2>How to Drink French Fluently: A Guide to Joie de Vivre with St-Germain Cocktails</h2><p><b>A cocktail book celebrating French conviviality with recipes featuring St-Germain liqueur. </b><br><br>Bring an effortless French sensibility to any occasion with the transporting flavor of St-Germain, the captivating elderflower liqueur beloved by bartenders everywhere. <i>How to Drink French Fluently</i> contains more than 30 cocktail recipes by some of the top names in the bartending world including Jim Meehan, Jeffrey Morgenthaler, and Julie Reiner.

T</b>he most persistent brunch-cocktail categories are popular for a reason: they work. There&#x2019;s certainly room for creativity on the service side of the brunch bar, but working within the parameters of classic brunch drinks is a wise move. &#x201c;No one wants to get into experimental drinks in the middle of the day,&#x201d; says Xavier Herit of New York&#x2019;s Wallflower.&nbsp;<br> <b><br>BRUNCH DRINKING = SESSION DRINKING. </b>The leisurely pace of brunch usually means multiple rounds are in order. &#x201c;You&#x2019;d like people to have two, three drinks and enjoy&#x2014;not have one and be done,&#x201d; says Lynnette Marrero of Brooklyn&#x2019;s Llama Inn. &#x201c;You want to have sessionable drinks on the brunch menu.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br> <b><br>PUT REFRESHMENT FIRST. </b>Daytime cocktails can certainly pack a kick, but their blow should be tempered with the most versatile tools available to brunch bartenders, fresh in-season fruit and bubbles among them. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a desire to not have these heavy, clunky drinks anymore. Citrusy, refreshing, sparkling cocktails tend to be very good at that time of day,&#x201d; says Marrero.&nbsp;<br> <b><br>DON&#x2019;T EXPECT A CURE. </b>It makes sense that many brunch enthusiasts are in the market for liquid relief. Don&#x2019;t get too wrapped up in this. &#x201c;We just make a good drink, and try not to assign any sort of mythological healing properties to it,&#x201d; says Jeffrey Morgenthaler of Portland&#x2019;s Clyde Common.&nbsp;<br><b>SAN PANCHO&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;MANZANILLA AND STRAWBERRIES ARE </b>very good friends,&#x201d; explains Caitlin Laman, a recent Mexico City transplant by way of San Francisco&#x2019;s Trick Dog, who combines the two for her south-of-the-border spin on a simple Collins.

Kennedy, is &#x201c;the most incredible Illuminati theory of them all.&#x201d; Marilyn Manson wrote a song based on &#x201c;King-Kill 33�,&#x201d; and even two rock bands, one in Atlanta and the other in Seattle, named themselves after Downard&#x2019;s piece.</p><p><br> <i>The Carnivals of Life and Death</i> is James Shelby Downard&#x2019;s thrilling life story, detailing the skullduggery and ritualism of the KKK and Freemasonry and how they imposed themselves on the young Downard and his family in Depression-era Deep-South America in the 1930s.</p><p><br>Editor Elana Freeland writes in her introduction, &#x201c;Downard&#x2019;s tale is a piece of the puzzle of a very important period when networks of fraternal orders were front and center in consolidating techniques of sociopolitical control.&#x201d;<br>Interest in the hidden aspects of Freemasonry is reaching boiling point today, and James Shelby Downard&#x2019;s eagerly awaited contribution to this secretive and little-known aspect of American culture will be widely read and discussed.</p></p><p>James Shelby Downard is said by Robert Anton Wilson that Downard&#39;s theory is &#34;The most absurd, the most incredible, the most ridiculous Illuminati theory of them all&#34;. Elana Freeland edited East West Journal in the mid-&#39;70s was a reporter for The Seattle Sun, 1979-80, and currently writes for mkzine.com, a website that reports on mind control abuses.Veteran readers of vivid conspiracy and Illuminati screeds may remember Downard from Adam Parfrey's <i>Apocalypse Culture</i> compilations or one of the man's own excursions into conspiracy theory, such as <i>King-Kill 33 [degrees]</i>, in which he detailed the alleged role of the Freemasons in the Kennedy assassination; it inspired a Marilyn Manson song. Here Downard tells his own story, touching, as so often elsewhere, on the sub rosa, commingled influences of the Freemasons and the Ku Klux Klan, not to mention FDR, on history. Dismissed as a conspiracy nut, considered a beacon of truth cutting through the fog by his adherents, Downard could write gripping prose full of piquant detail and his own weird experiences. "Sex circuses for public and private consumption are actually Masonic sex magick [<i>sic</i>] rites arranged by gringo Masonic sorcerers and greaser witches," begins his reminiscence of a 1934 trip to Memphis to explore the "Rite of Memphis" and attendant phenomena. Too dense to explain simply, too involved to dismiss out-of-hand, Downard's stuff must be experienced to be appreciated. <i>Mike Tribby</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Talk to any gamer in his twenties and at some point he&#x2019;ll say it: &#x201c;You&#x2019;re too young to get it. You never saw Other�world.&#x201d;<br><br>Now keep in mind, most of these idiots never experienced the original Other�world either. Even at the height of its popularity, it never had more than a handful of subscribers. It wasn&#x2019;t until years after the publisher pulled the plug that it became known in geek lore as the greatest game of all time.<br><br>I always thought that was bullshit. I don&#x2019;t anymore.<br><br>It took a twenty��something tech billionaire named Milo Yolkin to drag the game back from the dead. Today at noon, his company released an early-�access version of Other�world 2.0. Two thousand lucky gamers were chosen to test it, and somehow I&#x2019;m one of them. The original Other�world players were all dorks like me, but as far as I can tell, this new group of players has little in common aside from deep pockets. The app itself is free&#x2014;�you just have to buy the exclusive new headset that goes with the game. Only a couple thousand have been made, and each one costs over two grand.<br><br>I have no clue what the old Other�world looked like on a PC monitor when it came out over a decade ago. But I gotta admit&#x2014;�when I downloaded the new app and I put on the headset, I wasn&#x2019;t expecting graphics this good. I know everything is CGI, but my eyes are completely convinced that it&#x2019;s real. I&#x2019;ve got a plastic brick strapped to my face, there&#x2019;s sweat trickling out of my haptic gloves, and I&#x2019;d rather die than be seen in the dainty booties I&#x2019;m wearing. Back in the real world, my body is blind, deaf and helpless. I&#x2019;ve been in Other�world for over seventeen hours now, and there is no way in hell that I&#x2019;m leaving.<br><br>Of course, this world has been trying to kill me from the very first second I set out to explore. I&#x2019;ve encountered some truly insane shit so far&#x2014;�an avalanche, lighting strikes, quicksand and some kind of mutated polar bear that I managed to butcher and eat using nothing but a dagger and my two bare hands. Still, nothing compares to what I&#x2019;ve just found.<br><br>I&#x2019;ve come to a stone path that disappears into a cavern carved out of a glacier. I run my hand along one of the icy walls. I feel that it&#x2019;s there, but my fingertips can neither confirm nor deny that the surface is as smooth or as cold as it appears. I shouldn&#x2019;t have cheaped out when I bought the gloves, but the best ones were so expensive that they&#x2019;d have triggered a credit alert. I&#x2019;m sure I could have found a way around it if I&#x2019;d known the fancy gloves would be worth it. But none of the rumors prepared me for Other�world.<br><br>When I look up, I see a sun just like the one I&#x2019;ve always known burning in the sky. Its light penetrates the ice around me, and the whole glacier glows like an enchanted gem. I can hear water rushing somewhere deep within the glacier. A sharp crack echoes behind me, and I spin around a little too quickly. My stomach drops and hot vomit rises and scalds the back of my throat. They haven&#x2019;t found a way to truly beat the motion sickness yet. I close my eyes, swallow and wait until the dizziness fades.<br><br>Then I take a deep breath and open my eyes again. Stretching out toward the horizon is the empty ice field I just crossed. Somewhere in the distance is the City of Imra, where I began my journey. Apparently that&#x2019;s where all Other�world adventures begin. You design your avatar and walk through a door and suddenly you&#x2019;re outside Imra&#x2019;s gates. In the few minutes I was there, I watched a parade of avatars pass through them.<br><br>They&#x2019;re all still back there, I guess. They say the original Other�world could get pretty smutty, but I don&#x2019;t think it had anything quite like Imra. Apparently the city&#x2019;s a CGI Sodom that makes Grand Theft Auto look like Dora the Explorer. I was tempted to do a little sightseeing in town, but that seemed to be what the designers expected us to do. So I set off in the opposite direction. Away from the city. Down a mountainside. Into the wilderness. Across the ice fields. The way I figure it, when you&#x2019;re given a chance to explore the most incredible survival sandbox ever created, you shouldn&#x2019;t let yourself get slowed down by a few anatomically correct non-�player characters.<br><br>Now I&#x2019;m standing here in front of the ice cave, with the wind whistling all around me. It&#x2019;s a pity I can&#x2019;t feel anything but the steady chill of central air. If I breathe in too deeply, I can smell the Febreze my mom&#x2019;s cleaning lady uses. But my eyes are burning from snow glare, and my toes are numb. Before I enter the glacier, I turn one last time and scan the frozen white landscape behind me. There are no signs of movement, but I know I&#x2019;m not on my own. Someone&#x2019;s followed me here. She&#x2019;s always kicked ass at camouflage, and I haven&#x2019;t caught sight of her. But I don&#x2019;t need my eyes to tell me that Kat&#x2019;s in Other�world too. I feel her presence&#x2014;�and I&#x2019;m finding it hard to wipe the shit-�eating grin off my face.<br><br>Back in the real world, Kat hasn&#x2019;t spoken to me in months. I&#x2019;ve tried pretty much everything, and Other�world was my last resort. On Friday I left a set of gear in her locker, along with a note to let her know I&#x2019;d be logging on at noon today. I didn&#x2019;t think she could resist being one of the first to see Milo Yolkin&#x2019;s new wonderland. So I was pretty bummed when I didn&#x2019;t catch sight of her outside Imra. It&#x2019;s starting to look like my investment paid off, though. As far as I&#x2019;m concerned, a few thousand dollars of my mother&#x2019;s money is a small price to pay for the pleasure of Kat&#x2019;s company.<br><br>I step forward into the cave and stop. Lurking in a shadow is a figure I didn&#x2019;t see until now. Someone or something is guarding the entrance. I draw my dagger and prepare to strike. Everything around me may be fake, but the sound of my heart pounding is real. As my eyes adjust, I see a thin man dressed in what looks like a modern-�day suit. He&#x2019;s about a foot taller than I am, and there&#x2019;s a scarf wrapped Bedouin-�style around his head. The thin strip of face left uncovered is ebony black. In one hand the man holds a gnarled staff. An amulet hangs around his neck, a clear stone in its center. When the man doesn&#x2019;t move, I have a go at stealing his staff, but his grip remains firm. It&#x2019;s only when I try to take the amulet that I realize I&#x2019;m attempting to mug a statue. I rap my knuckles against its hollow chest. It seems to be sculpted from clay.<br><br>I suppose the clay man is a sign that I&#x2019;m on the right track. Open world or not, the developers wouldn&#x2019;t have placed a statue here for no reason. There&#x2019;s bound to be something interesting at the end of the path. And when I find it, I have a hunch that the statue will spring to life and show me what it can do with its staff. But why worry about that right now, when I can listen to the crunch of rocks beneath my bootie-�clad feet? Or watch chunks of ice bobbing in the Slurpee-blue stream that&#x2019;s flowing beside the path? The scenery alone is worth every single penny of the six grand I charged to my mom&#x2019;s credit card.<br><br>I plunge deeper into the glacier, occasionally sneaking a peek over my shoulder, hoping to catch Kat slinking up behind me. I&#x2019;m thinking about the two of us alone together in an icy blue cavern with a giant clay man guarding the door. It&#x2019;s been over a year since she and I have been by ourselves. I&#x2019;m enjoying the thought so much that when I turn a corner and see him, I almost mistake him for a rock.<br><br>He sits on a throne chiseled out of granite. His body is made of a gray material that looks like stone, and there&#x2019;s an impressive set of horns sprouting out of his head. He&#x2019;s human in shape, though he seems to be built on a much larger scale. Whoever he is, he feels no need for clothes. Heat radiates from him, and the melting ice walls form a sphere around his body. The moat of meltwater at his feet is clear, but I can&#x2019;t gauge its depth. On the opposite side of his chamber is a tall metal door that doesn&#x2019;t really fit with the decorating scheme. I&#x2019;m itching to find out what&#x2019;s behind it, but it&#x2019;s pretty obvious that I&#x2019;ll need to make it past the big dude first.<br><br>I make my way closer, and his head rises. I can&#x2019;t tell if he sees me, because he doesn&#x2019;t have a face, but I get the sense that he&#x2019;s not very happy. From what I&#x2019;ve read online, the lands of Other�world are ruled by demigods known as Elementals. This might be one of them. Some Elementals are helpful; many are hostile. I&#x2019;m guessing the creature in front of me isn&#x2019;t interested in making friends.<br><br>&#x201c;I wasn&#x2019;t expecting visitors.&#x201d; His voice booms in my headset and I have to turn the volume down.<br><br>Other�world&#x2019;s new publisher has spent months bragging about its next-�generation AI, but there&#x2019;s something that makes me think this guy&#x2019;s not part of the game. And if he&#x2019;s not an Elemental or an NPC, then I&#x2019;m not the only explorer around. Whoever this is, he&#x2019;s built a formidable avatar.<br><br>&#x201c;I guess not,&#x201d; I say into my mike. &#x201c;Looks like you forgot to get dressed. You know, a stud like you would be pretty popular back in Imra. I&#x2019;ve heard the place is a nonstop orgy. What are you doing out here when the action&#x2019;s back there?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I could ask the same of you,&#x201d; he says.<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah, well, I&#x2019;m allergic to fun. And mangos. Long-�haired cats, too.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How amusing,&#x201d; he says, giving my avatar the once-�over. &#x201c;You could have been anyone. And this is what you chose? What are you&#x2014;�a peasant?&#x201d; He sounds so . . . disappointed. &#x201c;Lack of imagination is a terrible affliction.&#x201d;<br><br>I glance down at my dull brown robe, sewn from the best cyberburlap available. Whenever I&#x2019;m given the option, I choose something similar.<br><br>&#x201c;I can think of worse,&#x201d; I tell him. &#x201c;Nothing wrong with keeping things simple. You know what they say: the flashier the avatar, the smaller the . . .&#x201d; I stop the instant he stands up. His crotch is nothing but a smooth bump. He&#x2019;s like one of the action figures I used to torture when I was a kid. &#x201c;You know, you&#x2019;re missing a little something down below.&#x201d; I gesture to his absent parts. &#x201c;They had some amazing options during setup. Might be worth a reset.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I appreciate your concern, but I have everything I need,&#x201d; he responds, moving toward me. &#x201c;The ice fields are no place for guests. I&#x2019;m afraid you must leave and return to the City of Imra.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Make me.&#x201d; It just pops out. Which happens more often than I&#x2019;d like. My tongue produces words faster than my brain can approve them.<br><br>&#x201c;Make you?&#x201d; he responds incredulously. &#x201c;Perhaps you&#x2019;re not aware that Other�world is intended for players eighteen and older? Did you lie when you registered?&#x201d;<br><br>I didn&#x2019;t, but what the hell does he care?<br><br>&#x201c;Spare me the lecture and get ready to rumble,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been battling the environment for seventeen hours straight, and it&#x2019;s time for bed. I need a little PVP action to put me to sleep.&#x201d;<br><br>The avatar approaches, and soon he&#x2019;s towering over me. Once again, I&#x2019;m blown away by the details. I can actually see veins throbbing in his chest, and though I&#x2019;m an eighteen-�year-�old hetero�sexual, even I recognize that the dude&#x2019;s nipples are works of art. &#x201c;You assume Other�world is like the games you know. I assure you it&#x2019;s not. You&#x2019;ve entered my sanctuary, and you are not welcome.&#x201d; The guy&#x2019;s beginning to glow from within like an ember. As his head lights up, features finally appear on his face, and I almost bolt. He does not look friendly.<br><br>Instead of running, I draw my dagger. &#x201c;Then you&#x2019;d better kick me out.&#x201d;<br><br>Before I can make a move, three flaming arrows zip past my shoulder. They miss the monstrous avatar and sink into the frozen arched ceiling above him. A second later, an explosion rocks the entire cavern. I steady myself and watch as ice rains down from above, burying the beast. I turn to find a sleek figure behind me. She&#x2019;s dressed in a body-�hugging suit of reflective material. It&#x2019;s hard to see her even though she&#x2019;s standing out in the open, but I&#x2019;d know the face anywhere.<br><br>&#x201c;You provoked that guy on purpose, Simon,&#x201d; Kat says. The voice is all hers, and it sets me on fire. &#x201c;Did you think you had any chance of winning a fight with that dinky little dagger?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Absolutely not. I figured you&#x2019;d show up and save me,&#x201d; I tell her. &#x201c;I wanted to see what you&#x2019;re wearing. Very nice.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go, dumbass,&#x201d; she orders. She&#x2019;s never been able to accept a compliment. &#x201c;He&#x2019;ll be out of there soon.&#x201d;<br><br>I glance back. The mysterious door behind the avatar is blocked now, so there&#x2019;s no real reason to stay. Kat is already retreating down the path, and I race to catch up, following her toward the entrance of the cavern. It&#x2019;s only when we&#x2019;re outside on the ice field that I realize something&#x2019;s different.<br><br>&#x201c;The clay man&#x2019;s gone,&#x201d; I say as it registers.<br><br>&#x201c;What clay man?&#x201d; she asks.<br><br>&#x201c;Never mind.&#x201d; It&#x2019;s not important, and there&#x2019;s much more that is. &#x201c;Listen&#x2014;�&#x201d; Just as I say it, the ground beneath our feet begins to rumble, and in moments the whole world is shaking around us.<br><br>&#x201c;Not now, Simon,&#x201d; she says.<br><br>&#x201c;Kat.&#x201d; I grab her hand and pull her toward me. There&#x2019;s no place to run. A geyser of lava erupts from beneath the ice and showers down on us. My crappy haptic gloves and booties are suddenly so hot that I yank them off and throw them across my bedroom. I keep the headset on, hoping for one last vision of Kat. All I see are sparks.</p><h2>Broca&#39;s Brain: Reflections on the Romance of Science</h2><p><b>A fascinating book on the joys of discovering how the world works, by the Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning author of <i>Cosmos</i> and </b><i><b>Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors.</b><br><br></i>&#x201c;Magnificent . . .

Much, Much More (Cheryl Harness Histories)</h2><p>The eagerly awaited third title in the Cheryl Harness Histories series paints a vibrant portrait of Theodore Roosevelt&#x2014;Rough Rider, trustbuster, explorer, President, and more&#x2014;whose bullish attitude forever changed America. <br><br>How did a sickly boy transform himself into one of the country's boldest leaders? You'll get the full story&#x2014;front page and behind-the-scenes&#x2014;as only Cheryl Harness can tell it. Through her lively narrative and engaging artwork, readers will see Teddy riding the range in South Dakota, charging up San Juan Hill in the Spanish-American War, climbing the political ladder all the way to the White House, breaking up big business, building the Panama Canal, and big-game hunting in Africa. They will also experience life in America when the telephone, airplane, and automobile were all brand-new, when women, blacks, and laborers were demanding equal rights, and when the cry for expansion stretched the borders from Maine to the Philippines and from Puerto Rico to Alaska. This was an age in which Roosevelt's promise to give every American a "square deal" and to "walk softly and carry a big stick" helped build the country into a world power. <br><br>With a new adventure on almost every page, readers will find themselves "wowed" by this true story of a larger-than-life American hero, and the country and times in which he lived.<br><br>National Geographic supports K-12 educators with ELA Common Core Resources.<br>Visit&nbsp;www.natgeoed.org/commoncore&nbsp;for more information.</p><p>Cheryl Harness is the author and/or illustrator of some 35 books for children, including 7 picture book biographies for National Geographic. She lives in Independence, MO. Visit Cheryl Harness on the Web at www.cherylharness.com.Grade 5&#x2013;8&#x2014;The appeal of this title lies in its folksy recounting of Roosevelt's very full life. That folksiness, however, sometimes gets in the way of strict nonfiction by including the author's personal opinions (our current day is termed the "dark and stormy 21st century"), uncited quotes (Which rancher wrote down "hasten forward quickly there" when TR called it out?), and fictionalized thoughts and incidents. A time line trails the bottom of the book's pages, highlighting major world events that occurred during Roosevelt's lifetime, but it does so independently from the text above it. For example, where the sinking of the USS <i>Maine</i> in 1898 is mentioned, the time line is stuck in 1889, so readers attempting to make a connection between the two may be confused. Black-ink drawings are copious&#x2014;and based on material Harness used to "visualize" the scenes, basically amounting to a fictionalizing of the illustrations as well, and the maps and family tree are crowded and difficult to interpret. The straight facts about the man are correct, though, and this is a balanced account, as the author points out some ironies in Roosevelt's life, such as the fact that although he was a great conservationist, he used an elephant foot as a wastebasket. So while not the soundest biography, this is more enjoyable than most series titles, and readers will come away knowing and understanding the man and his times.&#x2014;<i>Andrew Medlar, Chicago Public Library, IL</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

What will surprise some is that he owes so much of his dark and sometimes uncomfortably honest sense of humor to his mother, Bonnie. It was the cartoons in her <i>Hustler</i> magazine issues that molded the beginnings of his comedic journey, long before he was old enough to know what to do with the actual pornography. It was Bonnie who recited Monty Python sketches with him, introduced him to Richard Pryor, and rescued him from a psychologist when he brought that brand of humor to school. And it was Bonnie who took him along to all of her AA meetings, where Doug undoubtedly found inspiration for his own storytelling.<br><br><i>Digging Up Mother</i> follows Doug's absurd, chaotic, and often obscene life as it intersects with that of his best friend, biggest fan, and love of his life--his mother.

My friend Roger hovered outside the door. Moonbeams silvered the dresses and poured across the rose-patterned carpet, bleaching it to blues and grays. The stained-glass canary in the great peaked-arch window shone like a lamplit jewel.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It had been three months since I&#x2019;d exposed that thief--and imposter--Dudley. Three months of jumping and fetching, of pressing mountains of handkerchiefs, towels, and sheets, of doing a portion of the Wardrobe Mistress&#x2019;s job. But now things had settled down.

Lyric chirped drowsily in a puddle of moonlight. A quiver ran through the waking dresses. One hundred of them hung on silver hangers marked with numbered gold badges. They had all belonged to Queen Candace, the grandmother of Princess Mariposa. And although the dresses had been in this closet for years, they looked as bright and as new as they had on the day they were put there. Well, all except for one, Eighteen; faded rags were all that remained of the original dress.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Roger sidled into the closet and eased the door shut.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;The others are all downstairs,&#x201d; I pointed out.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Okay.&#x201d; Roger swept his cap off and ran his fingers through his sandy hair.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The dresses rattled their hangers. Roger jumped.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Be nice,&#x201d; I told them. &#x201c;You have a guest.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The dresses clattered their hangers more urgently. They&#x2019;d helped me thwart Dudley and his accomplice, Cherice. Those two had meant to unleash the dragons chained to the castle roof. Instead, Dudley had been carried off by the gryphon, and Cherice had escaped. The dragons were still captive. What more could the dresses want?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Do you think the dresses are alive?&#x201d; Roger whispered.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; I whispered back. &#x201c;Sort of. They&#x2019;re full of magic, so they seem alive.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;So are they or not?&#x201d; he asked, tucking his cap into his back pocket.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I chewed on my lower lip. I wasn&#x2019;t sure I could explain it. The dresses had a mind of their own; that much was sure. They slept when Lyric wasn&#x2019;t in the closet. And they could be killed. Eighteen was proof of that. I&#x2019;d left it off its hanger overnight. And though I&#x2019;d hung it back up as soon as I could, Eighteen no longer woke with the others.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Can anybody wear the dresses?&#x201d; Roger asked, distracted by a flapping sleeve.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The sleeve belonged to One, an aqua gown with gold-trimmed sleeves and a full skirt. It waved, straining its seams to catch my attention.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; I said, pulling One off its hanger.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I didn&#x2019;t know if this was true. Marci, who used to be the Head Scrubber but now was the Wardrobe Mistress, had worn the dresses when she was a child, but that was years ago. As far as I knew, no one else had.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;So there are rules,&#x201d; I went on. &#x201c;You can wear a dress outside, but not in the rain.&#x201d; I thought about that for a moment. &#x201c;Or in the snow--they&#x2019;re both wet. You can&#x2019;t leave a dress off its hanger. You have to wear it until you put it back.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Or what happens?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I inhaled deeply. &#x201c;The dress dies.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Roger stared at me as if that were crazy, but I plunged on.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Let me show you how this works.&#x201d; I slipped my arms into One&#x2019;s sleeves. The dress blurred around me as it snuggled up tight, instantly conforming to my size.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Roger flinched.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s still me,&#x201d; I told him, turning around to look in the mirror on the back of the closet door.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A smiling reflection greeted me. A lady with an elaborate hairdo stood in the mirror. I didn&#x2019;t recognize her, but her big diamond brooch told me she was wealthy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Roger jabbed my shoulder, snatching his finger back as if it had been burned.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Are you in there?&#x201d; he whispered.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s me, Roger,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Really. Here.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I stuck my hand out. He took it gingerly with two fingers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;See, it&#x2019;s like a mask. It looks like the lady in the mirror, but it&#x2019;s really me.&#x201d; I squeezed his hand. &#x201c;Doesn&#x2019;t it feel like me?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;It does,&#x201d; he said, snatching his hand back. &#x201c;Wow.&#x201d; He walked around me, studying me from every angle. &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t tell. It doesn&#x2019;t even sound like you.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I know.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Who are you--I mean, who is the lady?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;It could be some lady miles and miles away,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I considered that for a minute. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think so. It never has been before.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Wow,&#x201d; Roger repeated, and turned to rifle through the dresses. &#x201c;How long have they been here? Where&#x2019;d they come from? Who made them? A wizard? Are they enchanted--you know, like with a spell? Or a curse? Or--&#x201d; Roger took a deep breath. &#x201c;Maybe they&#x2019;re not really dresses. Maybe they&#x2019;re prisoners of a magical war--enchanted prisoners.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I rolled my eyes; he was starting to sound like one of my stories.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He hauled a dress off its hanger.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beside me, Lyric whistled.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;What are you doing?&#x201d; I asked.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;If it works for you, it should work for me,&#x201d; Roger said, stepping into the dress.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I held my breath. I&#x2019;d learned I couldn&#x2019;t wear a dress twice, but I hadn&#x2019;t worn this one yet. My stomach tightened. I&#x2019;d promised Roger to show him the closet and how the dresses worked, but sharing them was different. Weren&#x2019;t these my dresses? I&#x2019;d found them; I&#x2019;d worn them to save the Princess. Was it fair if Roger was able to wear them too?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Roger yanked the dress up and over his arms.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Nothing happened.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The dresses shivered with indignation. I fought the urge to giggle. Freckle-faced, sandy-haired Roger stood with a wave of flounces rippling around his shoulders. His striped shirtsleeves stuck out underneath. His work boots poked out under the trailing skirt.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Roger couldn&#x2019;t wear the dresses. Maybe the magic only worked for girls. Maybe it only worked for me.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I liked that idea. Only I, Darling the Dress Warrior, could wear these dresses.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s just a stupid dress.&#x201d; He picked at the skirt as if it had lice crawling on it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Take it off,&#x201d; I told him. &#x201c;Like I said, I&#x2019;m the only one.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t want to wear it anyway,&#x201d; he said, and dropped the dress, kicking it aside.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Nobody told you to.&#x201d; I picked the dress up off the carpet.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The badge on the empty hanger read Thirty-Seven. Had Roger ruined it? Could it still be worn? Gnawing my lower lip, I slipped out of One. I hung it back on its hanger, and then I slid into Thirty-Seven. It snapped to my size. A new lady greeted me in the mirror. I sighed with relief.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>At least he hadn&#x2019;t accidentally spoiled it for me.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Thirty-Seven simmered with excitement. The flounces fluttered about my shoulders anxiously. The skirt billowed as if caught by the wind, and the dress pulled me toward the closet door. I took an involuntary step forward.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go for a walk,&#x201d; I said. Thirty-Seven tingled in agreement.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Are you sure?&#x201d; Roger asked. &#x201c;Who are you now?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Lady What&#x2019;s-Her-Name,&#x201d; I said, pointing at the well-dressed lady in the mirror.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Thirty-Seven hauled me forward another step.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Where would we go?&#x201d; Roger asked.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Downstairs. A quick walk just to see what Thirty-Seven wants.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;What could a dress want?&#x201d; He pulled his cap out of his pocket and twisted it in his hands. As if he needed to be sure it was still only a cap.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what we&#x2019;re going to find out,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I opened the closet door and walked out.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Darling,&#x201d; he called after me, &#x201c;come back here!&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I ignored him and walked on, dragged along by an insistent Thirty-Seven. I heard the pounding of Roger&#x2019;s boots as he caught up. I smiled. I knew he couldn&#x2019;t resist. And neither could I, Darling Dimple, Intrepid Explorer. I navigated the castle&#x2019;s corridors, drawn forward by Thirty-Seven. The dress was wrought up about something. It would be interesting to see what.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;This is not a good idea,&#x201d; Roger groused in my ear.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s no worse than going out on the roof,&#x201d; I said, reminding him of what we&#x2019;d done last summer.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>At that, he fell into step beside me. &#x201c;Where are you goin&#x2019;?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I caught hold of the newel-post on the main staircase to avoid tripping over Thirty-Seven&#x2019;s lunging skirt. A low rumble of conversation rose up from below.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Roger grabbed me by the shoulder.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Someone will see you,&#x201d; he warned.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;No, Roger,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;They won&#x2019;t. They&#x2019;ll see Lady What&#x2019;s-Her-Name.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He frowned suspiciously. I wormed out of his grip and proceeded down the stairs. The sound of voices receded into the distance. Thirty-Seven hurried me after them; Roger dogged my heels.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The main hall flickered in the glow of candlelight. Hundreds of candles sat in sconces, beaming like little stars. It was so pretty. I caught my reflection in a mirror set in an alcove, and stopped to admire myself.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Lady What&#x2019;s-Her-Name had copper curls and blue eyes. Her gown shimmered an orange-red like the flames on the candles. Gold slippers peeked out from her hem. She was quite lovely. I turned my head this way and that, watching her curls bounce. My real hair was like the fluff of a dandelion; it defeated most attempts to tame it. Even now, I could feel my hair ribbon threatening to slide free. I reached up and pulled it out.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Are you finished?&#x201d; Roger asked, wiping his forehead with his sleeve. It was the first day of winter; I couldn&#x2019;t imagine how he could be too warm. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s find out what the dress wants and go back upstairs.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;In a moment,&#x201d; I said imperiously, waving my hand as I had seen ladies of the court do.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Is this young man bothering you, Lady Marguerite?&#x201d; asked a voice as mellow as an oboe.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It was a voice that sent shivers down my spine. Roger froze, freckles on fire. I turned to the slight figure of the Head Housekeeper, Mrs. Pepperwhistle. Roger didn&#x2019;t answer to her--he worked for the Stable Master--but the castle was her domain. She ruled the Upper-servants with her soft voice and her knee-melting sharp glance.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Thirty-Seven fell flat against me as if the wind carrying it had suddenly died. Evidently, it had decided that whatever it wanted could wait.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I smiled what I hoped was a reassuring smile. &#x201c;Not at all,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;What is a Stable Boy doing here at this hour?&#x201d; Mrs. Pepperwhistle wondered. Her black eyes measured Roger from head to foot as if she meant to order his coffin.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;He . . . ,&#x201d; I said with a little cough. &#x201c;He was reporting to me on my horse.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As far as I knew, Lady Marguerite could have ten horses or none at all. I only hoped Mrs. Pepperwhistle didn&#x2019;t have any idea either.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d have thought the Stable Master would be happy to answer your questions,&#x201d; she said, spying the aquamarine hair ribbon in my fist.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Resisting the urge to squirm, I looked her straight in the eye as I slipped the ribbon onto a little table beside me. I stepped away from the table and patted Roger on the shoulder.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t think of another Stable Boy who is a better hand with horses than little Roger here,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Really?&#x201d; Mrs. Pepperwhistle said. &#x201c;Indeed.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Sweat pooled under my arms, no doubt staining my own dress.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Good servants are priceless, don&#x2019;t you think?&#x201d; I smiled broadly. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m always delighted to discover one in Her Highness&#x2019;s service.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Mrs. Pepperwhistle murmured her agreement and, wishing me a good evening, melted into the shadows. Thirty-Seven danced a jig about my knees.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Roger smacked my arm with his cap.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Little Roger?&#x201d; he said.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I had to say something. I had to sound like Lady Whatever, didn&#x2019;t I?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Tugging his cap back on his head, he shrugged. &#x201c;I suppose, but couldn&#x2019;t you think of something else?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t say anything to help matters.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;She might come back. We should go,&#x201d; Roger urged.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Thirty-Seven twisted toward the main stair, signaling its agreement with Roger.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; I said, turning back to retrieve my ribbon, &#x201c;just a minute.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The tabletop was empty.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Roger,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;did you pick up my ribbon?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;What would I do that for?&#x201d; he asked, looking around as if he expected Mrs. Pepperwhistle to reappear at any moment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I dropped to the floor and felt under the table. I searched the alcove. I made Roger move his feet and pull out his pockets. But the ribbon was gone.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The aquamarine ribbon, a gift from Princess Mariposa, was one of only two treasures I owned. The other was the locket, strung on a slender chain, that had been left to me by my long-dead mother. The locket was a family heirloom, a heavy silver oval inscribed with a starburst on one side and the name wray on the other. Inside, it was empty. I liked to stay awake at night imagining the treasure that it had once held. Lately, I favored a magical ruby that granted wishes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This morning I rubbed my locket between my thumb and forefinger, thinking. I had set the ribbon on the table. There was only Roger and me standing there--Mrs. Pepperwhistle had never come near the table. What had happened to the ribbon?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The castle had magic-filled dresses and dragons chained to the roof--did it have ghosts, too? A tremor shook my right knee.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>No, I decided. There were no ghosts or specters, and absolutely no phantoms lurking anywhere in the castle. No, absolutely not.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And I didn&#x2019;t intend to start imagining that there were.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I arrived at the wardrobe hall just as Marci walked out of a closet with a cloak over her arm. She&#x2019;d changed since becoming Wardrobe Mistress. Her hair wreathed her head in a tidy braid. Her second chin had melted away, and her once-round figure had shrunk to a pleasing plumpness...</p></p><h2>Spiritual Guidelines for Souls Seeking God</h2><p><p>Habits of prayer are mere bondage unless they change who you are.

Moving effortlessly between the war-torn homeland and Orange County's "Little Saigon," Phan chronicles the journeys of four such orphans. Passionate and beautifully written, <i>We Should Never Meet</i> is an utterly fresh reconsideration of the Vietnam War for a new generation and heralds the arrival of one of "the very best of the new wave of Asian-American authors" (David Wong Louie).</p></p><p>Praise for <i>We Should Never Meet</i><br><br>"This extraordinary book creates with eloquent dignity an intricate bridge of human stories connecting America and Vietnam."<br>- Lan Samantha Chang, author of <i>Hunger: A Novella and Stories</i><br><br>"With this remarkably original and impressive debut Aimee Phan takes her place among the very best of the new wave of Asian-American authors. Few, if any, rival the literary ambition and thematic scope so evident in <i>We Should Never Meet</i>, which deftly spans generations, continents, and cultures. The lives revealed here are those of perhaps the most neglected victims of the Vietnam War, its orphans---those abandoned by American GIs and those who lost parents. Phan's loving but unflinching look at these displaced lives illuminates the murky heart of a forgotten American tragedy." <br>- David Wong Louie, author of <i>The Barbarians Are Coming </i><br> <br>"In Aimee Phan's collection of stories,<i> We Should Never Meet</i>, she accomplishes what only a true artist can: She gives voice to the voiceless and makes them speak for us all.

Chris Cherry is a newly minted sheriff's deputy, a high school football hero who has reluctantly returned to his hometown.

A Kentucky native, he now resides in Arizona.1 CHRIS<br><br> The body lay exposed, barely visible. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Maybe there was the gentle knurl of bone, dirty and ivory, and something brittle and flaking that might once have been fabric. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Something else, spidery and matted and awful and moving thick in the breeze, something that might have been hair. Human hair. It rustled with the grass and the black brush and dry mountain laurel, as if alive. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Human hair . . . and a bone.<br> Deputy Chris Cherry stood over the body, thinking, as a couple of Bulger&#x2019;s tigerstripe Herefords silently looked on. Bulger eyed him as well, propped up on his dirty Kawasaki four-wheeler, working a jaw full of Copenhagen and eating a peach. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; That was fucking talent. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Chris bent down, slow and careful, looking closer, before standing up again and wiping his hands on his uniform pants, even though he hadn&#x2019;t touched anything. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#x201c;How&#x2019;s the knee?&#x201d; Bulger asked over a mouthful of peach and long-cut dip. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; How&#x2019;s the knee? That&#x2019;s what everyone always said to him . . . Murfee&#x2019;s version of hello or goodbye. Another way of saying Welcome back or Damn shame, depending on who said it. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; How&#x2019;s the fucking knee? &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Chris ignored it. &#x201c;You found this earlier this morning?&#x201d; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Bulger made a face, spit a dark stream that looked bloody. &#x201c;Earlier, ayup. Didn&#x2019;t have time to call it in. Busy.&#x201d; He finished the peach, tossing it behind him in the direction of Chris&#x2019;s patrol truck, a Ford, painted Big Bend County blue and gray. It hit the ground a few feet short, and one of the Herefords slowly walked toward it, head down. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Chris knew that after he left, Bulger would call the sheriff and complain a shit storm about his driving the truck up onto the pasture. He wouldn&#x2019;t say anything now to Chris, just take it direct to the sheriff himself, who might or might not hear him out&#x2014;and who might or might not turn around and say something to Chris. Tough to say. Either way, Chris didn&#x2019;t feel bad about not hiking the five miles up from the ranch road to here, avoiding ankle-breaks and snakes and jackrabbit holes and whatever the hell else. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Bulger on his four-wheeler sure in the hell hadn&#x2019;t. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; How&#x2019;s the fucking knee?<br> Matty Bulger&#x2019;s place, Indian Bluffs, covered twenty thousand acres of crooked spine running along the Rio Grande river gorge. His family had owned it for decades after buying off a piece of the huge Sierra Escalera ranch. Matty had three sons and Chris had played football with the youngest, Nathaniel, at Big Bend Central. The two older boys still worked Indian Bluffs with their dad, but Nat was running hunting operations at Sierra Escalera, and Chris knew that pissed off Bulger to no end. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Nat had been a decent receiver, tall with good hands. He&#x2019;d been difficult to outthrow, scissoring along the sidelines beneath the big lights. Chris remembered Matty sitting in the stands, hollering Nat&#x2019;s name, pumping his blue-veined fists and watching his boy run. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#x201c;What we got? &#x2019;Nother dead beaner?&#x201d; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Chris shrugged. Probably. It was a fact of life in far West Texas, along the river: Mexicans crossing the border, looking for work, carrying drugs, carrying each other. The trip was hard and it wasn&#x2019;t unusual for a few not to make it whole, or at all. Some got sick drinking water out of dirty stock tanks; others were injured by the land itself. They&#x2019;d been known to break into ranch houses to steal food or to hide out for days in abandoned homes. Dupree had told him about a group that even called 911 on themselves after jimmying their way into a house. Lost and worn out, beaten, they&#x2019;d polished off all the beer in the fridge and sat outside smoking cigarettes, stinking of river mud, calmly waiting with four hundred pounds of weed sewn up in burlap, until Dupree and a couple of the other deputies showed up. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Dupree always laughed his ass off telling that story, drinking a Dr Pepper and drawing hard on a Lucky Strike.<br> The Big Bend of the Rio Grande was outlaw country. Always had been, always would be. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; It was the sharp curve where the Rockies met the northern Chihuahuan Desert, tough and beautiful and unforgiving. It was so bad, so rugged, so broken that it had been used to train astronauts for lunar walks. Big Bend, along with El Paso, Jeff Davis, and a handful of smaller counties, made up the bulk of the Texas side&#x2014;the Trans-Pecos&#x2014;more than 31,000 square miles. Big Bend County alone, anchored by Murfee and swallowing up whole both a state and a national park, was ten thousand miles of pure emptiness, patrolled by only six deputies and Sheriff Ross; all of it bigger than Delaware, Connecticut, and Rhode Island together. Just a few of a thousand places Chris had never been, probably would never go. It was a patchwork of ranches and river frontages and gorges shadowed by the Santiago, Chinati, and Chisos mountains, like deep cuts in dirty skin. If you looked hard enough, there were still the black pockmarks of ancient burned-out middens dotting the land, naked Indian arrowheads on the ground, and fading cave paintings up in the rocks. There were hills and valleys of cat&#x2019;s?claw and blackbrush and desert willow and mountain laurel, so much of it that when it rained good and hard, the waters were soon followed by an explosion of ground color rolling away as far as the eye could see&#x2014;all the way to Mexico, so bright it was hard to take in all at once. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; The rest of the time it was only bone and rust, just as hard on the eye but for different reasons, save for the odd patch of Bahia grass some ranchers tried for forage&#x2014;a green so pale it was merely a hint, so that if you looked one way or the other, it disappeared altogether. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Chris had once hoped to disappear from Murfee altogether as well.<br> Chris&#x2019;s dad used to say that the ranches squared the land into little kingdoms where men like Bulger crowned themselves kings. They didn&#x2019;t answer much to deputies like Chris, less even to the green-clad Border Patrol agents who worked the Rio Grande. The land got handed down from father to son, and they hired their own men&#x2014;more than a few illegals from right across the water&#x2014;and bunked them in cold barracks built with their own hands. They tended their sick and dying and buried them in family plots and paid out wages in wads of dollars. Some operations had gone modern and given up cutting dogs and horses for cutting gates, choppers, and four-wheelers. Loading chutes and trailer trucks had long replaced the dusty trail, and more than a few had taken to hiring hunting management consultants to set up big-game operations on back acreage. They streamed live video of elk and mule deer and made top dollar from weekend warriors wanting to pick their own antler racks with little or no fuss. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; But the ranches, and the ranchers, were Murfee, and always would be. No different from the handful of other little towns held hostage by the patchwork of fences and pastures drawn in the dust beneath all the gathered mountains. They defined life here, the ebb and flow of it. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; In his summers, Chris had worked his fair share of cattle operations all around Murfee. He&#x2019;d long known men like Bulger who didn&#x2019;t give a damn about what happened outside their fences and couldn&#x2019;t see much beyond them. Not all, though&#x2014;both Terry Macrae at Tres Rios and Dave Wilcher at the Monument set out food and clean water for the illegals crossing their lands looking for work, adopting a live-and-let-live view of it all. Wilcher went so far as to put up a small cottage near the gorge, a way station for those passing through, even though it drove the Border Patrol crazy. Chris had been out there and seen the wadded clothes, blown-out old shoes, even the maps the travelers had left behind. They&#x2019;d bought the maps down in Ojinaga. Crude things, pencil lines showing bare trails and roads and checkpoints and ranches like the Monument where desperate men&#x2014;desperate people&#x2014;could hole up for a few hours. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Still, so many didn&#x2019;t make it: drowned in the river in heavy rains, caught up in a cold snap or a sudden snow squall, more than a few catching a bullet behind the ear. All left for dead where they&#x2019;d fallen. Bodies were not uncommon out here in the emptiness. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Men like Bulger found them, unconcerned about the how or why, just waiting for men like Chris to clean up the mess.<br> Chris had grown up here and had been trying to leave it forever. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; His dad had been the town dentist and they&#x2019;d lived in Murfee proper, but after graduating from Big Bend Central, Chris had taken his football scholarship and gotten the hell out for what he thought was good, only to return for a hundred bad reasons that seemed far worse now&#x2014;like this god-awful moment, standing over bones and hair in the cold wind, with rain up in the mountains, darkening the far sky. Coming his way. And Matty Bulger waiting impatiently for Chris to do some goddamn thing so he could get back to work. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; His cell buzzed, dying before he even could reach for it. Service was spotty out here, the towers few and far between, and the radio was sometimes even worse, with the repeater in Stockton blocked by mountains. Either way, he&#x2019;d have to go back out to the main road to call this in. The lost call was probably Melissa. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; The lost call meant he&#x2019;d avoided another argument without even trying. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Chris was about to turn away, return to his truck, when something on the ground caught his eye. Not so much on the ground, but the ground itself: that little rim of earth holding the body in place. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Like hands holding something precious. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; He bent down again, careful for the second time, for a closer look. Bulger shifted behind him, finally sliding his ass off the four-wheeler, angling for a view of what had caught Chris&#x2019;s attention. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; His eyes followed the contours of the body, trying to make sense of it . . . where it began, where it ended, in the mess of earth. That disturbed dirt, loam broken up with rocks that might be bone&#x2014;all of it turned up, stinking like cow shit. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Turned up. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Unearthed. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; This body had been buried here. Not particularly well or deep, not at all, but it had been deliberately put into the ground until something, coyote or Mexican wolf, even a black bear, had scented it and dug it up. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Someone had hid it. The illegals crossing the area never buried one of their own, no matter how they&#x2019;d died. They left them naked, exposed, knowing the sun, wind, and rain had more time than they did to make them disappear. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; He saw it clearly then, perhaps the very thing that had made him take the second look to begin with&#x2014;his intuition working overtime on a problem he&#x2019;d been about to give up on. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Hands holding something precious. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; The body&#x2019;s hands were all there, puzzle pieces suddenly visible, both of them, held together tight. Wrist to wrist and pulled up close behind what could only be the curve of the spine, knees up by the broken jawbone, the way you might rope up a calf . . . or tie someone up. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Skeletal hands held together tight by a thick zip tie, taut like a sunning snake in the upturned earth. It still looked new, untouched; barely stained by the earth it had been buried in. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Chris rose up, his knee popping. It was a hard, sharp sound, carrying all the way to where Bulger stood, waiting. The rancher had asked if the body was another dead beaner, dirtying up his property, spooking his cows. Deputy Chris Cherry, who had been a deputy for less than a year, didn&#x2019;t think so. He didn&#x2019;t think so at all.<br><br> 2 ANNE<br><br> A nne stood in Tancy Garner&#x2019;s&#x2014;the dead woman&#x2019;s&#x2014;room, trying not to think about her. She had all the windows open, letting the October air wander through. A damp breeze shuffled the papers on the woman&#x2019;s desk. A ratty old solar system hung high in the corner, turning circles, orbiting itself and nothing at all. Saturn&#x2019;s cartoon rings bumped against water stains on the ceiling tiles. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Anne hoped the breeze, cold enough to pucker skin, might blow the dead woman&#x2019;s spirit away. Send it off to wherever it needed to go. She was ashamed that she was so grateful for the call that brought her here to Big Bend Central over a month into the school year; ashamed that it took another woman&#x2019;s death to get her back on her feet again. At least Tancy Garner hadn&#x2019;t died in the classroom. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; She was found in her kitchen, facedown in blood and milk, where she&#x2019;d passed away the night before while putting away a glass bottle. A strange fall, an accident, clipping her head on her counter on the way down. She&#x2019;d taught science, later English, at Big Bend Central for nearly twenty years. She&#x2019;d been a school fixture&#x2014;more like a monument&#x2014;respected and feared in fair measure, with her stern face, carved and weathered like rock, still staring out of old yearbooks and copies of school newspapers. And she was local, having spent her entire life in Murfee. Anne figured the old woman had been able to rope and ride and milk and whatever the hell else people who grew up on a ranch knew how to do. Things Anne had read about and seen a few times on the Discovery Channel. Of course, no one expected Anne to replace Tancy Garner, just get her classes through the end of the school year . . . finish things without too much disruption or chaos. Philip Tanner, BBC&#x2019;s principal, had made all that clear. Very clear. They&#x2019;d talk about a permanent position at the end of the year, if at all. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; We&#x2019;ll just see, Ms. Hart. We&#x2019;ll just see then. Anne shuffled things around on the desk&#x2014;her desk, for at least a while. It was a holiday, Columbus Day. The school was pretty much empty, except for her. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; She&#x2019;d pulled into Murfee late on Thursday, got the keys to the little house she was renting the next morning right after she&#x2019;d met with Tanner, and had spent the past three days over the long weekend getting settled. Tomorrow there would be students sitting in these old chairs, staring at her while they texted and whispered. A few had gotten a glimpse of her on Friday, had maybe already picked up on their new teacher&#x2019;s name, and if BBC was like every other school&#x2014;and it was&#x2014;the rumor mills would&#x2019;ve been turning since. She figured she would know by the second period on Tuesday, or Wednesday morning at the latest, just how much anyone knew about her.</p><h2>A Confessor&#39;s Handbook: Revised and Expanded Edition</h2><p>Now revised, this is a guide filled with practical, straightforward advice, examples, and suggestions on how a confessor might celebrate the sacrament of reconciliation more effectively with his parishioners.</p><p>Kurt Stasiak, OSB, has been a monk of Saint Meinrad Archabbey since 1975, a priest since 1980.

Come in here about four hours late, you look like shit and you stink.

I stood around there and I waited for him.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Both of them wore black boots with red suede inserts. The first one wore an army-green poncho, a frayed gray sweater and faded blue jeans. He had long hair, dirty-blond, and mutton-chop sideburns. The second one wore an army-green poncho, a gray sweatshirt and dirty white jeans. He had long black hair that reached his shoulders. He had the beginnings of a black beard.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I hadda get my dogs in,&#x201d; the second one said. &#x201c;I got fourteen dogs, there. Takes me a while. I can&#x2019;t, I can&#x2019;t just go. off some place, leave them dogs out.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re all covered with hair, too,&#x201d; Amato said. &#x201c;You been backing them dogs up to you, I guess.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Comes from beating off, Squirrel,&#x201d; the second one said. &#x201c;I come out, I haven&#x2019;t got your advantages, nice business waiting for me, all that. good shit. I got to hustle.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c; &#x2018;Johnny&#x2019; around here,&#x201d; Amato said, &#x201c;you can call me &#x2018;Johnny&#x2019; here.

I got to put up with shit like this?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I could&#x2019;ve,&#x201d; the first one said, &#x201c;but you asked me, you know, get somebody that was all right.

How about going out and getting me a nice tough nigger? I don&#x2019;t think I can stand this cocksucker long enough to tell him what I want.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Russell, for Christ sake,&#x201d; the first one said, &#x201c;willya shut the fuck up and stop jerking the guy&#x2019;s chain? He&#x2019;s tryin&#x2019; to do us a favor.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t know that,&#x201d; Russell said. &#x201c;I thought he wanted us to do him a favor.

You tryin&#x2019;, do nle a favor?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Get the fuck out of here,&#x201d; Amato said.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Hey,&#x201d; Russell said, &#x201c;that&#x2019;s no fuckin&#x2019; way, talk to a guy. The fuck you sell driving lessons to people, you go around talking to a guy like that?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;This thing I got in mind,&#x201d; Amato said, &#x201c;the two guys I get to do it&#x2019;re gonna cut up about thirty, I figure.

She was up to Concord once. I said to her, I said: &#x2018;Sister, I wanted to play the guitar, I would&#x2019;ve grabbed a fuckin&#x2019; guitar.&#x2019; After that she left me alone. Lot of the guys liked her, though.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;That night the nigger was in the hospital,&#x201d; Frankie said.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Good,&#x201d; Amato said. &#x201c;I hope he fuckin&#x2019; died.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Nope,&#x201d; Frankie said, &#x201c;but I seen him. He was missing about three feet of skin off his fuckin&#x2019; head.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Hey,&#x201d; Amato said.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Him,&#x201d; Frankie said, nodding his head toward Russell.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;No shit,&#x201d; Amato said.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Peeled him like a fuckin&#x2019; orange,&#x201d; Frankie said.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;More like pulling bark off a fuckin&#x2019; tree,&#x201d; Russell said. &#x201c;Guy had skin like nothing I ever seen.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;He came after you?&#x201d; Amato said.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Somebody sure did,&#x201d; Russell said, &#x201c;somebody looked to me like he hadda be the biggest chungo bunny inna world, come after me. I had this blade there, another guy I meet onna way over, he told me, I give him a hundred out of my thing there and he had this blade for me. Said I was probably gonna need it. I bet I wasn&#x2019;t in there ten minutes and that nigger&#x2019;s coming after me. Didn&#x2019;t do it again, though.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s how come,&#x201d; Frankie said. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s a prick but he&#x2019;s got all the moves.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;He clean?&#x201d; Amato said. &#x201c;Both you guys clean?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Frankie,&#x201d; Russell said, &#x201c;you been using something?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Shut the fuck up, all right, Russell?&#x201d; Frankie said.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Yeah. I haven&#x2019;t had anything but booze since I get out. Not that much booze, either. Mostly beer. I been waiting for payday, I start in on the VO and other stuff.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re on pills,&#x201d; Amato said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re in, you&#x2019;re on pills. I seen you, don&#x2019;t forget. You were beating the hell out of them yellowjackets.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;John,&#x201d; Frankie said, &#x201c;the yellowjackets were there. I didn&#x2019;t see nobody serving no beer. I took what there was. I haven&#x2019;t had none of that stuff since I was out.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;How about him?&#x201d; Amato said.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Gee, Squirrel,&#x201d; Russell said, &#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t take nothing. I, ah, I probably had a couple quarts of Ripple and some grass, and I might&#x2019;ve had one or two dime bags once or twice, but I just snort them, you know? It&#x2019;s not like I was using something. I go to Cub Scouts, you know? And they pat you down, there, they start teaching you how to tie them knots and everything.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Smack,&#x201d; Amato said to Frankie. Frankie shrugged. &#x201c;I ask you to find a guy for me and I got this thing, and all I got to do is do it and we get some very nice money. All I got to do is find two guys that can do a fairly simple thing without fucking it up, and this is the best you can do for me. A fuckin&#x2019; junkie. And I&#x2019;m supposed to just let you guys go in there and you&#x2019;re gonna go in and once and for all you&#x2019;re gonna fuck it up, a job that&#x2019;s never gonna come around again in a million years. I don&#x2019;t want to have a whole lot of fun with this thing, you know, because I hadda go out and get a guy that looked all right when I got him and then he goes in and he&#x2019;s on the fuckin&#x2019; nod or something. I want the goddamned money. That&#x2019;s what I need.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Squirrel,&#x201d; Russell said, &#x201c;when I was a little kid I used to take off on Cheracol. I didn&#x2019;t have any trouble. When I was working for my Uncle, I used to have to go down in holes for him, you know? The carbon black on my face and go down in them holes with a forty-five in my hand and a knife in my fuckin&#x2019; teeth and I went into them tunnels. Every day I went in them tunnels. If there wasn&#x2019;t anything in the tunnel, that was a good day. Not so good days, there&#x2019;s probably only a big fuckin&#x2019; snake in there or something that wants to eat you. Kinda bad days, there&#x2019;s some skinny dink in there with a gun, tryin&#x2019; to kill you. Bad days was when the dink did it, or there was a piece of wire in there and you didn&#x2019;t happen, you weren&#x2019;t paying attention or something and it&#x2019;s rigged up to something that blows up pretty quick, or else there&#x2019;s a punji stick in there with a whole lot of dink shit on it under your hand and you go into your basic blood poisoning extra quick.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t have no bad days,&#x201d; Russell said. &#x201c;I was in them tunnels almost two years and I didn&#x2019;t have no bad days. I wasn&#x2019;t buying up Mustangs and teaching little dumb shits to drive, but I didn&#x2019;t have no bad days, either.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;The thing of it is, Squirrel,&#x201d; Russell said, &#x201c;when I was having them days, I didn&#x2019;t know for sure at the time that I wasn&#x2019;t gonna have a bad one, you know? I started out, I thought it was all just a matter of balls. I don&#x2019;t wanna hurt your feelings or anything, but I always had the balls, you know? And I thought, I felt pretty good, because I thought that&#x2019;s all it was and I had them so I was all right. Then I see, I seen them cart out a couple guys that went in there and put them in the green bags, you know? And a couple of them, they didn&#x2019;t have no balls when they come out, on account they didn&#x2019;t have no luck, they went in that time, and no cocks either, and that carbon black, don&#x2019;t do a thing for cuts and stuff. Fuckin&#x2019; booby traps go right through it, like it wasn&#x2019;t even there.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;So that gets me to thinking,&#x201d; Russell said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m no good at thinking. But that gets me to thinking, and I see, well, I&#x2019;m in the shit, is what I am, and I can&#x2019;t personally do nothing about it. All I can do is, I can have the balls and the luck, but the only thing I know about is the balls. I just can&#x2019;t have no bad days. Only, I don&#x2019;t know no way to do that. So, I used to come out, and I know, tomorrow I go in again, and the only thing I can think about is, I used up another day. That&#x2019;s all. So I smoke something. And it helped.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Then I start looking at them other guys,&#x201d; Russell said. &#x201c;I see them, I was still thinking, and they&#x2019;re all, most of them, at least&#x2019;re smoking. And them guys that&#x2019;re doing the grass, you know? Very heavy on it, and they slow down some. I was, I was keeping track of things. I could see it happening to me, it was happening to them, I got it a little bit and I begin to see, that&#x2019;s what, them other guys, they started on it, it was probably just a little bit for them, too, when they start. You start forgetting things. All you want, you don&#x2019;t care about things, you know? Very funny thing. And then, some of the guys that&#x2019;re older, they drink a lot. And pretty soon they&#x2019;re sick a lot. And that&#x2019;s bad. Their hands shake. They&#x2019;re not paying attention either. And you get in there, there&#x2019;s the wire or the dink or something, well, you&#x2019;re gonna have to have a lot of time to think about it or else you&#x2019;re not gonna have no time at all. You can&#x2019;t let yourself get slow.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;So I try the horse,&#x201d; Russell said. &#x201c;You got to have something. So I some of that nice white shit, and what I did was, I used it after, right? After I come out again. I haven&#x2019;t got to go back in tonight. First I snort it. Then, a couple times I did it the other way, but mostly I snort it. But I used it. And I liked it.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; Russell said, &#x201c;it don&#x2019;t, it makes you feel great, but it don&#x2019;t actually do nothing for you, you know that. When you&#x2019;re in there, doesn&#x2019;t protect you at all. But you been in, and you got out, and you got to go back in again and you don&#x2019;t want to think about that, maybe you&#x2019;re not gonna bring yourself out, you go in again, use up all your luck thinking. So then it&#x2019;s very fuckin&#x2019; nice. Don&#x2019;t slow you down. Just makes you feel good, and that&#x2019;s what I was after.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Sure,&#x201d; Amato said, &#x201c;and that&#x2019;s what you&#x2019;re gonna be after when you&#x2019;re getting ready to go in on this thing I got, and you&#x2019;re gonna get it and you&#x2019;re gonna be flying and you&#x2019;re gonna go in stoned up to your ass and some poor bastard&#x2019;s gonna start hollering or something and he&#x2019;s gonna get shot, and a very good thing that a kid in his fuckin&#x2019; right mind couldn&#x2019;t fuck up is gonna get fucked up. That&#x2019;s exactly what I&#x2019;m afraid of.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;ll be all right, John,&#x201d; Frankie said.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Maybe he&#x2019;ll be all right,&#x201d; Amato said. &#x201c;Maybe he won&#x2019;t be all right. Maybe you won&#x2019;t be. I don&#x2019;t want nobody getting hurt on this. There&#x2019;s nothing, there&#x2019;s no reason why anybody oughta get hurt on this, the guys that go in or the guys that&#x2019;re in there when the guys go in. This&#x2019;s money, just money, nothing else. No fuckin&#x2019; shit and stuff that&#x2019;s gonna get everybody all pissed off and everything. It was something that was gonna be around, it was something like that, all right, I could maybe take a chance. I could take a couple guys that I was afraid&#x2019;d maybe cock off and wreck it, and take their word for it, they&#x2019;re gonna be all right. So all right, they go in, and they cock off and wreck it, it was a bank or something, it&#x2019;s gonna be there next week for two guys that&#x2019;ve got more sense, all right. But this isn&#x2019;t. It&#x2019;s not like that. You fuck it up, it&#x2019;s fuckin&#x2019; gone, it&#x2019;s gonna disappear. I got to think about this. I got to be sure. I&#x2019;m gonna talk to some people.&#x201d;</p></p><h2>A Watermelon, a Fish and a Bible: A heartwarming tale of love amid war</h2><p><p><b>A moving novel of love and war by the author of <i>The Beekeeper of Aleppo</i></b></p><p>It is July 1974 and on a bright, sunny morning, the Turkish army has invaded the town of Kyrenia in Cyprus.

The military successes of European imperialism are easy to explain; in many cases they were a matter of firearms against spears. But as Alfred W. Crosby maintains in this highly original and fascinating book, the Europeans&#39; displacement and replacement of the native peoples in the temperate zones was more a matter of biology than of military conquest. European organisms had certain decisive advantages over their New World and Australian counterparts. The spread of European disease, flora and fauna went hand in hand with the growth of populations. Consequently, these imperialists became proprietors of the most important agricultural lands in the world. In the second edition, Crosby revisits his now classic work and again evaluates the global historical importance of European ecological expansion.</p><p>In this original and fascinating study, Alfred W.

Many have been wiped out and forgotten. A statistic in a chart somewhere gathering dust. A distant memory, if remembered at all. However, each has a story to tell. A story of those final moments of life and death. A story that just might save your skin, if you're interested and willing to listen. Within the confusion and chaos of oilfield disasters are valuable lessons from the honorable efforts of great explorers. Great oil men and women dealing with adversity, fighting to survive. This book gives tribute to them.<br><br>The cause of undesirable oilfield situations is sometimes simple, sometimes complex, but always unforgiving. Often it comes down to one's actions or inaction. Hesitate to shut a job down for safety, men die. Poor communication on location, men die. Neglect to perform the proper calculations, men die. Lack of attention to detail, men die. When the stakes are high, there is little room for error, as will be shown throughout the book when we step into the steel toe boots of others as they deal with oilfield challenges. Learning from the experience of others is a key principle of the Oilfield Survival Series. The philosophy is best summed up with a 2,200-year-old quote from old Latin literature:&nbsp;<br><br>"It is better to learn from the mistakes of others than that others should learn from you."</p><h2>If You Love It, It Will Grow: A Guide To Healthy, Beautiful Natural Hair</h2><p>HOLISTIC CARE FOR NATURAL HAIR!!

But nonprofit institutions are different; they aim for <em>social profit</em>. How do you measure the success of these social profit institutions, where missions are focused on the well-being of people, place, and planet?</p> <p>Drawing upon decades of leadership in schools and the foundation and nonprofit worlds, author David Grant offers strategies&#x2015;from creating <em>mission time</em> to planning backwards to constructing qualitative assessment rubrics&#x2015;that help organizations take assessment back into their own hands, and improve their work as a result. His insights, illustrated by numerous case studies, make this book a unique organizational development tool for a wide range of nonprofit organizations, as well as emerging mission-based social venture businesses, such as low-profit corporations and B Corps.</p> <p><em>The Social Profit Handbook </em>presentsassessment and evaluation not as ends in themselves but as the path toward achieving what matters most in the social sector. The result: more benefits to society <em>and</em> stronger, more unified, more effective organizations prepared to make the world a better place.</p></p><p><p>David Grant is the former president and CEO of the Geraldine R. Dodge Foundation in Morristown, New Jersey, where he was responsible for development and evaluation of programs in the foundation&#x2019;s major areas of giving (Arts, Education, and Environment), as well as the foundation&#x2019;s major initiatives (Poetry and Nonprofit Capacity Building). Grant now consults with people and organizations that have a social or educational mission, specializing in strategic planning, design of assessment systems, and board development. During his years at the Dodge Foundation, Grant delivered over a hundred keynote addresses on a range of topics, led workshops titled <em>Measuring What Matters</em> for over two hundred nonprofit organizations, and received numerous awards.</p> <p>Grant's career has centered on innovative teaching and learning. In 1983, he and his wife, Nancy Boyd Grant, cofounded The Mountain School of Milton Academy, a highly regarded, semester-long, interdisciplinary environmental studies program in Vermont for high school juniors from throughout the country. Previously, David was a national consultant to schools and leader of workshops on topics of curriculum and program design, professional development, assessment practices, and school climate.</p> <p>He has served as chair of the board of the Council of New Jersey Grantmakers and a member of the board of directors of the Surdna Foundation. He is currently a trustee of three social profit (formerly called nonprofit) organizations.</p> <p>He lives in Strafford, Vermont.</p><p>&#x201c;This handbook is nothing less than revolutionary, and just what we need. If you can describe the change you most want to create, you can measure it, and others will come to value what you measure. Social profit, mission time, planning backwards: here&#x2019;s the answer to how we measure what matters most, focus our attention, and get to where we actually want to go as change-makers. David Grant is the most level-headed, poetic voice for how we might all live and perform closer to our own values. Three times now, his simple and provocative teaching have shifted the way I think and act, and through this book we can share his nuanced, accessible teaching with everyone. I will give this book to every social profit organization with whom I collaborate.&#x201d;--<strong>Peter Forbes</strong>, coauthor of <em>A Man Apart</em>, and cofounder of the Center for Whole Communities</p><br><br><p>&#x201c;For many years, David Grant has helped our organization create firm foundations for new projects and initiatives through the principles outlined in this excellent roadmap for rethinking success. At last his guidance and wisdom are available to anyone fortunate enough to come across this book.&#x201d;<strong>--Robert Lynch, President and CEO, Americans for the Arts</strong></p><br><br><p>"Anyone in the business of improving lives&#x2015;whether they spend their days in government or in mission-driven organizations&#x2015;can benefit from this simple, elegant, and incisive guide to having not just&nbsp;<em>more</em>&nbsp;impact, but also the&nbsp;<em>right</em>&nbsp;impact. David Grant has produced a book that belongs on the shelves of every political and social leader interested in translating goals to successes."<strong>--Peter Welch, Congressman, U.S. House of Representatives</strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;It has been my good fortune to help launch and run about a dozen mission-driven organizations over the past several decades. When I finished David Grant's wonderful new book, one thought eclipsed all others. Damn, I thought, I sure wish I had had this guide all those years! What a blessing that would have been!&#x201d;<strong>--James Gustave Speth, author, <em>Angels by the River</em>; founder, World Resources Institute; cofounder, Natural Resources Defense Council</strong></p><br><br><p>"Normally, when I hear the word<em> assessment</em>, I consider a nap. But&nbsp;<em>The Social Profit Handbook</em>&nbsp;is different.&nbsp; I enjoyed the jogging pace of the writing, the personal narrative, the linguistic memes for easy transmission. Even better, I'm already integrating David Grant's approach into existing assessment tools. Grant's fresh framework emphasizes formative feedback and rubrics to guide your team toward high performance. This is essential reading for mission-driven leaders dedicated to constantly improving their work.&#x201d;<strong>--Adam Werbach, cofounder, Yerdle; former president, Sierra Club</strong></p><br><br><p>"Wow. Who would have thought a book on assessment could be so compelling! If you are looking for a way to get your board and staff aligned and mobilized around a practical, &nbsp;impact-driven strategy, Grant&#x2019;s handbook is essential.&#x201d;<strong>--George Hamilton, President and CEO of the Institute for Sustainable Communities</strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;I read&nbsp;<em>The Social Profit Handbook</em>&nbsp;over a weekend. My first day back in the office I recommended it to a new executive director and to one of my senior colleagues and referred to its core concept twice in my senior team meeting. Those of us who lead, oversee, and work in social purpose organizations all know how setting out to describe a compelling vision and to hold ourselves accountable to reach it can be treacherous and disorienting. David Grant has written a timely and valuable guide that reminds us how important that journey is and describes how we can all build a map to navigate it with confidence.&#x201d;<strong>--Antony Bugg-Levine, CEO,&nbsp;Nonprofit Finance Fund; founding board chair of the Global Impact Investing Network; former managing director of the Rockefeller Foundation</strong></p><br><br><p>"Over many years of hosting grantee workshops led by David Grant, I have watched hundreds of individuals shift their mindsets before my very eyes. Executive directors and board members alike move from a palpable distaste and fear of assessment to a place where they embrace it as a major capacity-building tool. Like those workshops,&nbsp;<em>The Social Profit Handbook&nbsp;</em>gives every nonprofit or mission-driven business the tools they need to determine&nbsp;what 'success would look like' if they vigorously pursue what matters most to them. David's approach can help readers focus on mission and goals in entirely new ways."<strong>--Wendy Liscow, program director, education and capacity building,&nbsp;Geraldine R. Dodge Foundation</strong></p><br><br><p>"David Grant's&nbsp;<em>Social Profit Handbook&nbsp;</em>is exactly what a handbook should be&#x2013;accessible, enjoyable, practical, yet linked to important and thought-provoking theory. I have already applied his rubric assessment framework to my ongoing work as a consultant, as his examples are both refreshing and inspiring. Using his comforting educator's voice, Grant powerfully reframes perennial stumbling blocks into questions that can lead to responsible organizational approaches. I have spent my career attempting to improve the performance of foundations and nonprofits, and I genuinely see this resource as a breath of fresh air in the pursuit of effective implementation of strategy. This book will be a permanent resident on my 'foot-long bookshelf.'"<strong>--Nadya K. Shmavonian, former executive of The Rockefeller Foundation and The Pew Charitable Trusts</strong></p><br><br><p>"Grant has the ability to take on incredibly big ideas, distilling them in a way that sustains their breadth and power, and bringing them into the civic sphere. In&nbsp;<em>The Social Profit Handbook</em>, Grant challenges disheartedness in our sector by providing a rational and aspirational context by which social profit can be better understood and pursued."<strong>--Clement A. Price, founding director of the Institute on Ethnicity, Culture, and the Modern Experience, Rutgers University</strong></p></p><h2>One Candle: A Hanukkah Holiday Book for Kids</h2><p><p>For one family the traditional Hanukkah celebration has a deeper meaning. Amidst the food and the festivities, Grandma and Great-Aunt Rose begin their story -- the one they tell each year. They pass on to each generation a tale of perseverance during the darkest hours of the Holocaust, and the strength it took to continue to honor Hanukkah in the only way they could. Their story reaffirms the values of tradition and family, but also shows us that by continuing to honor the tragedies and the triumphs of the past there will always be hope for the future.</p></p><p><p>Eve Bunting was born in Ireland and came to California with her husband and three children. She is one of the most acclaimed and versatile children's book authors, with more than two hundred novels and picture books to her credit.

Ms. Popp lives and works in upstate New York with her husband, Bill, and two children, Zoe and Wynn.</p>Gr. 2-3, younger for reading aloud. When Grandma and Grandpa arrive for Hanukkah celebrations, Grandma always brings a potato--but not for the traditional potato latkes, which are already filling the house with a luscious aroma. When prayers, candle lighting, and dinner are complete, Grandma, sitting beside Great-Aunt Rose, tells the familiar family story of how a potato that she smuggled from the kitchen at Buchenwald became a light of hope, uniting the girls in the barracks to one another and to the heroic Maccabees of long ago. Popp invests her art with all the emotion of Bunting's heartfelt text--the affection of a close-knit family celebrating the sorrow of lost friends and relatives, and the courage that grew out of tragic times. The sepia palette is infused with glowing light for scenes in the camp while dollops of color distinguish the contemporary celebration. There's a photo-realistic quality to Popp's portraiture that makes it seem as if she has used models from life that she knows well and loves. A gentle but forthright opening for discussion about the Holocaust. <i>Stephanie Zvirin</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

But until Phyllis Chesler's now-classic book, a profound silence prevailed about woman&#x2019;s inhumanity to woman. Women's aggression may not take the same form as men's, but girls and women are indeed aggressive, often indirectly and mainly toward one another. They judge harshly, hold grudges, gossip, exclude, and disconnect from other women.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like men, women are exposed to the messages of misogyny and sexism that permeate cultures worldwide. Like men, women unconsciously buy into negative images that can trigger abuse and mistreatment of other women. But like other social victims, many do not realize stereotyping affects members within the victimized group as well as those outside the group. They do not realize their behavior reflects society's biases.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How women view and treat other women matters. Are women oppressed? Yes. Do oppressed people internalize their oppressors' attitudes? Without a doubt. Prejudice must first be acknowledged before it can be resisted or overcome. More than men, women depend upon one another for emotional intimacy and bonding, and exclusionary and sexist behavior enforces female conformity and discourages independence and psychological growth.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Continuing the pioneering work begun in <i>Women and Madness</i>&#x2014;Chesler's bestselling book that broke the story on double standards in psychology&#x2014;<i>Woman's Inhumanity to Woman </i>draws on important studies, revolutionary theories, literature, and hundreds of original interviews. Chesler urges us to look within, to treat other women realistically, ethically, and kindly, and to forge bold and compassionate alliances. This is a necessary next step for women, without which they will never be liberated.</p></p><p><b>Phyllis Chesler</b>, author of eighteen books and thousands of articles and speeches, is also an emerita professor of psychology and women's studies at City University of New York, a psychotherapist, and an expert courtroom witness.

She lives in Manhattan."A heady amalgam of research . . . again, Chesler's voice is breathtakingly bold, ruthlessly honest, provocative, challenging and compassionate. This is rough terrain, and Chesler is leading the way.

In this lucid book, she explores a topic forbidden among feminists for too long. She provides an understanding of jealousy and anger among women, yet she is also compassionate.

I find Chesler's careful perspective confirming, provocative and comforting." &#x2014;Judy Grahn, poet and author of <i>Another Mother Tongue: Gay Words, Gay Worlds</i><br><br>&#x201c;Phyllis Chesler has one of the most original and provocative minds in modern American feminism. It has always been her style to turn the conventional wisdom on its head, and take us wherever that leads.

First published in 1608, the commentaries came at an appropriate time. Contemporary accounts noted that witchcraft and sorcery had "spread in all directions," leaving "no country, town, village, or district, no class of society" free from the practice. This probing work, by a distinguished writer and scholar who perceived the devil as an evil force seeking to destroy men's bodies and souls, was an attempt to help man live piously and devoutly, thus guarding against such seductions and manipulations.<br>Reproduced from a rare limited edition published in 1929 and supplemented with many erudite editorial notes by the Rev. Montague Summers, the Compendium Maleficarum includes profoundly serious discussions of witches' pacts with the devil, finely detailed descriptions of witches' powers, poisons, and crimes; sleep-inducing spells and methods for removing them, apparitions of demons and specters, diseases caused by demons, and other topics. Also examined in detail are witches' alleged powers to transport themselves from place to place, create living things, make beasts talk and the dead reappear; witches' use of religion to heal the sick, laws observed by witches to cause and cure illness, differences between demoniacs and the bewitched, and other subjects from the realm of the supernatural.<br>Here is an encyclopedic tract of incalculable worth to the historians and student of the occult and anyone intrigued by necromantic lore, sabbats, sorceries, and trafficking with demons.</p><p>The <b>Compendium Maleficarum</b> was the ultimate field guide for the beginning demonologist in the 17th century. Guazzo's <b>Compendium</b> was accepted by his contemporaries as the authoritative manuscript on witchcraft. Later demonologists continued to hail the conciseness and clarity with which Guazzo analyzes the practice. The <b>Compendium</b> not only gives an organized account of the subject matter but provides a glimpse at the Christian view of witchcraft during the early 17th century.Text: English, Latin (translation)</p><h2>Dark Visions: The Strange Power; The Possessed; The Passion</h2><p><b> GIFTED AND CURSED </b> <br> <br> Kaitlyn Fairchild has always felt like an outsider in her small hometown. Her haunting eyes and prophetic drawings have earned her a reputation as a witch. But Kait's not a witch: She's a psychic. Tired of being shunned, Kait accepts an invitation to attend the Zetes Institute, where she can have a fresh start and study with other psychic teens. <br> <br> Learning to hone her abilities with four other gifted students, Kait discovers the intensity of her power -- and the joy of having true friends. But those friendships quickly become complicated when Kait finds herself torn between two irresistible guys. Rob is kind and athletic, and heals people with his good energy. Gabriel is aggressive and mysterious, a telepath concealing his true nature as a psychic vampire, feeding off of others' life energy. Together, Rob and Gabriel's opposing forces threaten the group's stability. <br> <br> Then one of the experiments traps the five teens in a psychic link. A link that threatens their sanity and their lives. And Kaitlyn must decide whom to trust...and whom to love.</p><p>L.J. Smith is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of the Night World and Vampire Diaries series.&nbsp;She has written over twenty-five books and lives in California.Dark Visions CHAPTER 1<p></p> <br>You don&#x2019;t invite the local witch to parties. No matter how beautiful she is. That was the basic problem.<br> <br>I don&#x2019;t care, Kaitlyn thought. I don&#x2019;t need anyone.<br> <br>She was sitting in history class, listening to Marcy Huang and Pam Sasseen plan a party for that weekend. She couldn&#x2019;t help but hear them. Mr. Flynn&#x2019;s gentle, apologetic voice was no competition for their excited whispers. Kait was listening, pretending not to listen, and fiercely wishing she could get away. She couldn&#x2019;t, so she doodled on the blue-lined page of her history notebook.<br> <br>She was full of contradictory feelings. She hated Pam and Marcy, and wanted them to die, or at least to have some gory accident that left them utterly broken and defeated and miserable. At the same time there was a terrible longing inside her. If they would only let her in&#x2014;it wasn&#x2019;t as if she insisted on being the most popular, the most admired, girl at school. She&#x2019;d settle for a place in the group that was securely her own. They could shake their heads and say, &#x201c;Oh, that Kaitlyn&#x2014;she&#x2019;s odd, but what would we do without her?&#x201d; And that would be fine, as long as she was a part.<br> <br>But it wouldn&#x2019;t happen, ever. Marcy would never think of inviting Kaitlyn to her party because she wouldn&#x2019;t think of doing something that had never been done before. No one ever invited the witch; no one thought that Kaitlyn, the lovely, spooky girl with the strange eyes, would want to go.<br> <br>And I don&#x2019;t care, Kaitlyn thought, her reflections coming around full circle. This is my last year. One semester to go. After that, I&#x2019;m out of high school and I hope I never see anyone from this place again.<br> <br>But that was the other problem, of course. In a little town like Thoroughfare she was bound to see them, and their parents, every day for the next year. And the year after that, and the year after that.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br> <br>There was no escape. If she could have gone away to college, it might have been different. But she&#x2019;d screwed up her art scholarship&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and anyway, there was her father. He needed her&#x2014;and there wasn&#x2019;t any money. Dad needed her. It was junior college or nothing.<br> <br>The years stretched out in front of Kaitlyn, bleak as the Ohio winter outside the window, filled with endless cold classrooms. Endless sitting and listening to girls planning parties that she wasn&#x2019;t invited to. Endless exclusion. Endless aching and wishing that she were a witch so she could put the most hideous, painful, debilitating curse on all of them.<br> <br>All the while she was thinking, she was doodling. Or rather her hand was doodling&#x2014;her brain didn&#x2019;t seem to be involved at all. Now she looked down and for the first time saw what she&#x2019;d drawn.<br> <br>A spiderweb.<br> <br>But what was strange was what was underneath the web, so close it was almost touching. A pair of eyes.<br> <br>Wide, round, heavy-lashed eyes. Bambi eyes. The eyes of a child.<br> <br>As Kaitlyn stared at it, she suddenly felt dizzy, as if she were falling. As if the picture were opening to let her in. It was a horrible sensation&#x2014;and a familiar one. It happened every time she drew one of those pictures, the kind they called her a witch for.<br> <br>The kind that came true.<br> <br>She pulled herself back with a jerk. There was a sick, sinking feeling inside her.<br> <br>Oh, please, no, she thought. Not today&#x2014;and not here, not at school. It&#x2019;s just a doodle; it doesn&#x2019;t mean anything.<br> <br>Please let it be just a doodle.<br> <br>But she could feel her body bracing, ignoring her mind, going ice-cold in order to meet what was coming.<br> <br>A child. She&#x2019;d drawn a child&#x2019;s eyes, so some child was in danger.<br> <br>But what child? Staring at the space under the eyes, Kait felt a tugging, almost a twitch, in her hand. Her fingers telling her the shape that needed to go there. Little half circle, with smaller curves at the edges. A snub nose. Large circle, filled in solid. A mouth, open in fear or surprise or pain. Big curve to indicate a round chin.<br> <br>A series of long wriggles for hair&#x2014;and then the itch, the urge, the need in Kait&#x2019;s hand ebbed away.<br> <br>She let out her breath.<br> <br>That was all. The child in the picture must be a girl, with all that hair. Wavy hair. A pretty little girl with wavy hair and a spiderweb on top of her face.<br> <br>Something was going to happen, involving a child and a spider. But where&#x2014;and to what child? And when?<br> <br>Today? Next week? Next year?<br> <br>It wasn&#x2019;t enough.<br> <br>It never was. That was the most terrible part of Kaitlyn&#x2019;s terrible gift. Her drawings were always accurate&#x2014;they always, always came true. She always ended up seeing in real life what she&#x2019;d drawn on paper.<br> <br>But not in time.<br> <br>Right now, what could she do? Run through town with a megaphone telling all kids to beware of spiders? Go down to the elementary school looking for girls with wavy hair?<br> <br>Even if she tried to tell them, they&#x2019;d run away from her. As if Kaitlyn brought on the things she drew. As if she made them happen instead of just predicting them.<br> <br>The lines of the picture were getting crooked. Kaitlyn blinked to straighten them. The one thing she wouldn&#x2019;t do was cry&#x2014;because Kaitlyn never cried.<br> <br>Never. Not once, not since her mother had died when Kait was eight. Since then, Kait had learned how to make the tears go inside.<br> <br>There was a disturbance at the front of the room. Mr. Flynn&#x2019;s voice, usually so soft and melodious that students could comfortably go to sleep to it, had stopped.<br> <br>Chris Barnable, a boy who worked sixth period as a student aide, had brought a piece of pink paper. A call slip.<br> <br>Kaitlyn watched Mr. Flynn take it, read it, then look mildly at the class, wrinkling his nose to push his glasses back up.<br> <br>&#x201c;Kaitlyn, the office wants you.&#x201d;<br> <br>Kaitlyn was already reaching for her books. She kept her back very straight, her head very high, as she walked up the aisle to take the slip. KAITLYN FAIRCHILD TO THE PRINCIPAL&#x2019;S OFFICE&#x2014;AT ONCE! it read. Somehow when the &#x201c;at once&#x201d; box was checked, the whole slip assumed an air of urgency and malice.<br> <br>&#x201c;In trouble again?&#x201d; a voice from the first row asked snidely. Kaitlyn couldn&#x2019;t tell who it was, and she wouldn&#x2019;t turn around to look. She went out the door with Chris.<br> <br>In trouble again, yes, she thought as she walked down the stairs to the main office. What did they have on her this time? Those excuses &#x201c;signed by her father&#x201d; last fall?<br> <br>Kaitlyn missed a lot of school, because there were times when she just couldn&#x2019;t stand it. Whenever it got too bad, she went down Piqua Road to where the farms were, and drew. Nobody bothered her there.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry you&#x2019;re in trouble,&#x201d; Chris Barnable said as they reached the office. &#x201c;I mean&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I&#x2019;m sorry if you&#x2019;re in trouble.&#x201d;<br> <br>Kaitlyn glanced at him sharply. He was an okay-looking guy: shiny hair, soft eyes&#x2014;a lot like Hello Sailor, the cocker spaniel she&#x2019;d had years ago. Still, she wasn&#x2019;t fooled for a minute.<br> <br>Boys&#x2014;boys were no good. Kait knew exactly why they were nice to her. She&#x2019;d inherited her mother&#x2019;s creamy Irish skin and autumn-fire hair. She&#x2019;d inherited her mother&#x2019;s supple, willow-slim figure.<br> <br>But her eyes were her own, and just now she used them without mercy. She turned an icy gaze on Chris, looking at him in a way she was usually careful to avoid. She looked him straight in the face.<br> <br>He went white.<br> <br>It was typical of the way people around here reacted when they had to meet Kaitlyn&#x2019;s eyes. No one else had eyes like Kaitlyn. They were smoky blue, and at the outside of each iris, as well as in the middle, were darker rings.<br> <br>Her father said they were beautiful and that Kaitlyn had been marked by the fairies. But other people said other things. Ever since she could remember, Kaitlyn had heard the whispers&#x2014;that she had strange eyes, evil eyes. Eyes that saw what wasn&#x2019;t meant to be seen.<br> <br>Sometimes, like now, Kaitlyn used them as a weapon. She stared at Chris Barnable until the poor jerk actually stepped backward. Then she lowered her lashes demurely and walked into the office.<br> <br>It gave her only a sick, momentary feeling of triumph. Scaring cocker spaniels was hardly an achievement. But Kaitlyn was too frightened and miserable herself to care. A secretary waved her toward the principal&#x2019;s office, and Kaitlyn steeled herself. She opened the door.<br> <br>Ms. McCasslan, the principal, was there&#x2014;but she wasn&#x2019;t alone. Sitting beside the desk was a tanned, trim young woman with short blond hair.<br> <br>&#x201c;Congratulations,&#x201d; the blond woman said, coming out of the chair with one quick, graceful movement.<br> <br>Kaitlyn stood motionless, head high. She didn&#x2019;t know what to think. But all at once she had a rush of feeling, like a premonition.<br> <br>This is it. What you&#x2019;ve been waiting for.<br> <br>She hadn&#x2019;t known she was waiting for anything.<br> <br>Of course you have. And this is it.<br> <br>The next few minutes are going to change your life.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m Joyce,&#x201d; the blond woman said. &#x201c;Joyce Piper.

His own brand of humane and humorous exposition of the mysteries of Christian doctrine is little-known in the West, yet remains a prime example for any modern Christian teacher of how to make the faith intelligible and attractive.This newly augmented collection of translations into English is by the world-renowned scholar of Syriac, Dr Sebastian Brock, formerly Reader at the Oriental Institute of the University of Oxford. The elegant precision of his versions captures the beauty and charm of the originals, which were intended to be sung by a congregation to popular melodies, with refrains.One poem added to this newly expanded collection demonstrates the unique quality of St Ephrem in expounding central doctrines of the faith. In it he compares the action of God becoming incarnated in the Man Jesus to a parrot-trainer who encourages a parrot to talk like a human by placing a mirror in its cage so it can see another parrot apparently speaking and thus learn to imitate it. God became Man so that human beings might learn to relate to Him as one of themselves and by imitation be lifted up to a divine plane of being.Razvan Porumb, Development Officer at the Cambridge Institute, says of this beautifully produced volume that every committed Orthodox Christian should have it by them. THE HARP OF THE SPIRIT is a delightful gift by which to mark an important occasion and a valuable present to any preacher seeking to refresh his or her addresses by a fresh infusion of the Spirit!</p><p></p><h2>Power Blender Revolution: More Than 300 Healthy and Amazing Recipes That Unlock the Full Potential of Your Vitamix, Blendtec, Ninja, or Other High-Speed, High-Power Blender</h2><p>High-horsepower power blenders are revolutionizing the kitchen habits of millions of people.

One of our finest cultural and architectural historians, Rybczynski renders a graceful, original, and engaging portrait of the tool that changed the course of civilization.</p><p>In 1999, an editor of the <i>New York Times Magazine</i> approached Witold Rybczynski, the well-known student of architecture and urban design, and asked him to write a short essay on the best and most useful common tool of the past millennium. Rybczynski took the assignment, but when he began to look into the history of the items in his workshop--hammers and saws, levels and planes--he found that almost all of them had pedigrees that extended well into antiquity. Nearly ready to admit defeat, he asked his wife for ideas. Her answer was inspired: "You always need a screwdriver for something."<p> True enough. And, Rybczynski discovered, the screwdriver is a relative newcomer in humankind's arsenal of gadgetry, an invention of the late European Middle Ages and the only major mechanical device that the Chinese did not independently invent. Leonardo da Vinci got to it early on, of course, as he did so many other things, designing a number of screw-cutting machines with interchangeable gears. Still, it took generations for the screw (and with it the screwdriver and lathe) to come into general use, and it was not until the modern era that such improvements as slotted and socket screws came into being. </p><p> Rybczynski's explorations into that lineage, here expanded to book length, are highly entertaining, and sure to engage readers interested in the origins of everyday things. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>Witold Rybczynski has written about architecture and urbanism for <i>The New York Times</i>, <i>Time</i>, <i>The Atlantic</i>, and <i>The New Yorker</i>. He is the author of the critically acclaimed book <i>Home</i> and the award-winning <i>A Clearing in the Distance</i>, as well as <i>T</i><i>he Biography of a Building</i>, <i>T</i><i>he Mysteries of the Mall</i>, and <i>Now I Sit Me Down</i>.

Betsy Lerner takes us on a powerfully personal literary journey, where we learn a little about Bridge and a lot about life.</p><p>After a lifetime defining herself in contrast to her mother&#x2019;s &#x201c;don&#x2019;t ask, don&#x2019;t tell&#x201d; generation, Lerner finds herself back in her childhood home, not five miles from the mother she spent decades avoiding. When Roz needs help after surgery, it falls to Betsy to take care of her. She expected a week of tense civility; what she got instead were the Bridge Ladies. Impressed by their loyalty, she saw something her generation lacked. Facebook was great, but it wouldn&#x2019;t deliver a pot roast.</p><p>Tentatively at first, Betsy becomes a regular at her mother&#x2019;s Monday Bridge club.

No sooner does she cross state lines than old patterns reemerge, old conflicts flare. Everything her mother says feels like a referendum on her life: her hair, her frayed jeans, throwing away money on Starbucks, and why does she always have to wear black! All the entrenched mother-daughter behaviors return full force. The generation gap seems wider than ever. </p><p>Enter the Bridge Ladies, a small band of five women who have been playing cards with her mother, Roz, on Mondays for more than fifty-five years&#x2014;still clad in matching outfits, heels, their hair done, and still serving luncheon on linen, china, and silver.&nbsp; After Roz had some surgery, each one visited with a meal. Betsy admired their loyalty. She knew if she ever got sick her friends would probably send her texts: <em>Feel better! Miss you!</em> Facebook was great, but it wouldn&#x2019;t deliver a pot roast. </p><p>Tentatively at first, Betsy joins the Monday bridge group, and eventually learns to play the game that &#x201c;well acquaints you with your deficits.&#x201d; Over time, she gets to know the ladies and, most surprisingly, her mother. Bridge becomes a metaphor for crossing the emotional divide.

Your nervous system is different than most. You are uniquely designed as a highly sensitive person, one who can join Jesus in the work He began and continues to do--reconciling people to God, to themselves, and restoring relationships between people.

Each marquee is faithfully recreated using beautiful lithographic printing on the highest quality paper. Back in 2015, Bitmap Books teamed up with arcade enthusiast Tim Nicholls to publish the first edition of Artcade, a labour of love that was borne out of Nicholls quest to restore his massive archive of original arcade game artwork comprised of titles from the last four decades. This new Extended Edition builds on the original concept by adding a larger selection of memorable marquee artwork which looks even more striking now, thanks to the wider format of the book. There is also a lot more side panel and cabinet art this time around, giving you a better overall picture of the complete machine, and what it would have looked like in it&#39;s full glory.

An in-depth how-to chapter contributed to by Escape Pod, one of the world&#39;s leading creators of high-quality restored arcade artwork serves as a great taster for those of you who are entertaining the idea of picking up a battered coin-op classic and bringing it back to life.

After what just happened, she&#x2019;s stunned. Frozen. And then&#x2014;imagine it&#x2014;Annabelle&#x2019;s wrecked self suddenly takes off like a lightning bolt. She&#x2019;s clutching the white bag, which has the unfortunate word, Dick&#x2019;s, stamped across it in orange. Her burger is still warm. She&#x2019;s holding the Coke, too, which sloshes like a stormy sea as she tries to outrun the bad visions of the recent past. French fries spring loose in the bag, and it shakes around like a maraca.<br> <br>Of course she&#x2019;s heard that saying&#x2014;A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. Coach Kwan has a poster of it in his office. It shows the silhouette of a girl at sunset, running up a steep mountain path, and it&#x2019;s all clouds parting and God rays shining down and purple mountain majesties. There is no panic and dropped napkins and hair flying. That poster does not look like this.<br> <br>Where is she going? No idea.<br> <br>Why is she going? Well, sometimes you just snap. Snapping is easy when you&#x2019;re already brittle from the worst possible thing happening. It is easy when you&#x2019;re broken and guilty and scared. You snap just like that. Like the snap has been waiting around for the right moment.<br> <br>So, now, Annabelle Agnelli is no longer trying to hold it together in the Dick&#x2019;s Drive-In parking lot. She&#x2019;s lost it. Utterly lost it. She&#x2019;s ditched her car entirely, and she&#x2019;s jogging down the sidewalk, fast, at a really good clip. Coach Kwan would be proud. She&#x2019;s getting sweaty and her mind is swirling, and it&#x2019;s all a little unhinged for the straight-A student that she is. She is a good and nice person who keeps things together, but that has been a big job, an enormous job, a job that&#x2019;s way, way too big for her lately.<br> <br>It gets worse. Of course, this is what often happens: Things get worse and worse still. A spiral follows gravity downward. She&#x2019;s been running for who knows how long, and it starts to get dark. It&#x2019;s metaphor-darkness, but it&#x2019;s also just the truth. Night falls. Big clouds cross the sky, threatening rain. So many things are falling&#x2014;night, rain, the last of the stuff holding Annabelle Agnelli together.<br> <br>She&#x2019;s halfway down Seattle&#x2019;s busy thoroughfare of Broadway.

She has no idea what time it is, though. People with hunched shoulders and their jacket hoods up are walking their dogs. Little dogs and big dogs are pulled and yanked&#x2014;there&#x2019;s no time for luxurious sniffing with the sky that black. There&#x2019;s a bicyclist or two or twenty, speeding home after work, their wheels zizzing by her. Backpacks are slung over their shoulders. Their tight, shiny bike pants shoot past, meteor streaks of luminescent yellow. Streetlights plink on.<br> <br>She keeps running. There&#x2019;s a little pit-pat of rain, nothing major. The burger bag is gone (in a trash can, she hopes, though she can&#x2019;t say for sure), but Annabelle still has the Coke, and her purse bangs against her side. She stopped by Dick&#x2019;s after hanging out with Zach Oh and Olivia, and so she&#x2019;s wearing her jeans and a sweater and she&#x2019;s way, way too hot. Her jacket is in the car; her regular running clothes and shoes are back at home. None of this matters.<br> <br>Now, she&#x2019;s past Leschi and then Seward Park, and it&#x2019;s a little creepy out that way, with the lake a deep indigo and the big evergreens shaking their boughs overhead. This is the thing she wants to outrun: the creepiness. Not only the creepiness of Seward Park and the creepiness that just happened at Dick&#x2019;s, but all creepiness, all powerlessness, all moments where you feel your fate in someone else&#x2019;s hands.<br> <br>Seriously, she should not be running in this part of the city at night. People get hurt here. Robbed. Killed. She feels a weird fearlessness. Whatever. Come and get me, she thinks. Do you think I care?<br> <br>Then, she thinks something else: I could keep going and going.<br> <br>This is where big ideas come from&#x2014;a flash across the brain screen in moments when all the circuits are throwing sparks. The where and the why and the I don&#x2019;t know form the tiniest ball of cells you&#x2019;d need a microscope to see.<br> <br>Big ideas can lead to great things. Big ideas can lead to disaster. The cells begin to divide.<br> <br>Her phone has been buzzing in her pocket. She is hours late getting home. People are worried. She brushes away the thought, but then the responsible-person guilt collides with the burn in her legs and the ache in her toes. This is a large part of Annabelle Agnelli&#x2014;the weight of what she owes everyone. It makes the gears of her anxiety click and whirl. Finally, she stops. She&#x2019;s panting hard.<br> <br>There is a park off to her left. She&#x2019;s lived in Seattle all her life, but she&#x2019;s never been out here. GENE COULON MEMORIAL BEACH PARK, the sign reads. CITY OF RENTON. She slurps down the Coke, crushes the cup. Crushing things feels awesome. She walks in a circle until her breath regulates, because she knows what will happen to her muscles if she doesn&#x2019;t. Her chest burns.<br> <br>Help me, Kat, Annabelle thinks. What do I do?<br> <br>Keep going, Kat answers.<br> <br>See? Kat is her best friend, so she understands. Kat knows Annabelle better than anyone, except maybe a certain someone who is losing her mind right about now. A certain someone who is calling and calling. Annabelle reaches for her buzzing phone.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m okay, Mom,&#x201d; she answers.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, God, Annabelle. Dear Jesus, where the hell are you?&#x201d; Yes&#x2014;God, Jesus, and hell in a ten-word sentence is really packing it in there, but this is Gina Agnelli. For her, being Catholic isn&#x2019;t just about religion&#x2014;it&#x2019;s about superstition and safekeeping and tradition. She rarely goes to mass, but she&#x2019;s got the required crucifix over the kitchen doorway, the rosary in the dresser drawer, and the stack of dead relatives&#x2019; funeral cards, held together with a rubber band. It&#x2019;s almost hard for Annabelle to believe that people are still Catholic. But the Catholic church is something that&#x2019;s been around for a zillion years and will keep on being around for a zillion years, in spite of the bad press and rumors of vanishing, kind of like Hostess Twinkies.<br> <br>How can Annabelle believe in anything anymore, though? It&#x2019;d be nice to have belief, but it&#x2019;s likely gone for good.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m at Gene Coulon Park. In Renton?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What? Why? Who are you there with? Have you been drinking?&#x201d;<br> <br>Ha. Annabelle wishes. &#x201c;No, I haven&#x2019;t been drinking! I ran here.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You ran there? What do you mean, you ran there? Where&#x2019;s the car? Christ in heaven, do you know how worried I was? I was worried sick.&#x201d;<br> <br>Worry! Annabelle&#x2019;s mother is always worried! She was worried even before last year, even before there was reason. Worry is another way Gina tries to keep everyone safe. Worry is a different version of prayer. Here is what happens when your mother worries: You become secretly worried. Anxiety plays in your background like bad grocery store music. You pace and count stuff and wake at night, your heart beating too fast. You pretend to be brave, and do stuff to prove you&#x2019;re not a scared person like she is. The constant worry (over your whereabouts, over certain friends, over anything and everything, but always the wrong things) bashes into your head: You are not safe. The world is full of danger and treachery. You don&#x2019;t have a chance.<br> <br>Look what good all that worry did anyway.<br> <br>How can you feel safe? It is a complicated question. Which is fitting, because Annabelle is complicated. Hidden behind all that nice-and-pretty, she is desperate and grief-stricken.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m fine, Mom.&#x201d;<br> <br>Of course she is not. She is most definitely not fine.<br> <br>&#x201c;Malcolm was trying to ping you, whatever that means! And I almost called Grandpa to go look for you, that&#x2019;s how frantic I was. Annabelle, you can&#x2019;t just disappear for hours.&#x201d;<br> <br>Malcolm: Annabelle&#x2019;s younger brother. Technological genius, thirteen-year-old MacGyver. Brainiac, irritant, little buddy. Ed Agnelli: Grandpa. Nickname: Capitano. Former owner and boss of a frozen fish packing company, who retired and became the solo skipper of his own ship&#x2014;an RV he drove around the country. Currently&#x2014;their next-door neighbor. Add in Bit the dog: breed unknown. Small, brown and tan. Superfast underwear snatcher. Also, Carl Walter: Mom&#x2019;s occasional boyfriend, division manager of AT&amp;T. Rabid Seahawks fan. Still thinks Pop-Tarts and Hi-C are decent nutritional choices. Finally: Anthony. Annabelle and Malcolm&#x2019;s dad. Former high school athlete and runaway parent, now Father Anthony, a priest at Saint Therese&#x2019;s near Boston. Also known as: That Bastard Father Anthony, which is what Gina&#x2019;s called him ever since he left six years ago, after saying he&#x2019;d had enough. Annabelle&#x2014;she has stopped calling him altogether.<br> <br>There it is: La famiglia. The family.<br> <br>&#x201c;Annabelle? Annabelle! Are you there?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m here.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Why are you so quiet? You&#x2019;re making me nervous.&#x201d;<br> <br>Oh, mothers can drive you nuts, but mothers know you.<br> <br>It&#x2019;s now or never.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not coming home.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What do you mean, you&#x2019;re not coming home? Of course you&#x2019;re coming home. I&#x2019;ve got my car keys in my hand. Malcolm!&#x201d; she shouts. &#x201c;Look up Gene Colon Park on GPS!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Not Colon. Coulon. Cu.&#x201d; A wave of hysteria rises up. She almost laughs. Cu is an abbreviation for culo, Italian slang for ass. &#x201c;But you don&#x2019;t need to come now. I&#x2019;ve got a hundred and twenty bucks of birthday money in my wallet. I saw a Best Western a ways back.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll be there in a half hour, if I don&#x2019;t get lost.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not coming home. I mean it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Annabelle. Stop this right now. I mean it. I&#x2019;m the one who gets to mean it! What happened at Zach Oh&#x2019;s? Something happened.&#x201d; Gina says Zach&#x2019;s name really fast. Zackos. It sounds like the online shoe-shopping site for people who&#x2019;ve lost their minds.<br> <br>&#x201c;Nothing happened at Zach&#x2019;s.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Is this some Dungeons and Dragons thing?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Mom, no. . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>How to explain it? Even to herself?<br> <br>She replays the scene: She is leaving Zach&#x2019;s. She actually feels good. She&#x2019;s light, lighter than she&#x2019;s been in months. They&#x2019;d even had fun. Driving home, she spots the snowy ridge of the Cascade Mountains in the distance. It&#x2019;s so beautiful that it fills her with a Nature&#x2019;s Wonders surge of gratitude. Her iPod plays. It&#x2019;s an old song she snitched from her mother&#x2014;British alternative, rising good energy, from the time of shoulder pads and big hair. I&#x2019;m alive! So alive!<br> <br>She flinches at the words, but she ignores it. Up ahead, she sees the slowly spinning Dick&#x2019;s sign. The delicious smell of grilling burgers marches through her heater vents. On a whim, she pulls in. She&#x2019;s suddenly starving. It&#x2019;s so alive hunger. It feels good.<br> <br>She orders, and then slides the money through the bank-teller-ish window of Dick&#x2019;s. She pushes the little lever of the box for a straw, yanks a stack of napkins. She collects her bag and her drink. And then she turns around.<br> <br>There are two young guys in line behind her. The one in the army jacket is obviously drunk. He half leans on his friend. &#x201c;Hey, beautiful,&#x201d; he slurs to Annabelle. &#x201c;Hey, come here.&#x201d;<br> <br>He steps toward her. He reaches for her arm. She feels his fingers through her sleeve.<br> <br>&#x201c;Chad, come on, man,&#x201d; the other guy says.<br> <br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s beautiful. I want beautiful.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Chad, knock it off.&#x201d;<br> <br>Annabelle wrenches her arm free. She tries to pass, but can&#x2019;t pass. The so alive vanishes. She stands there with her bag, paralyzed and small. The friend steers drunken Chad into another line.<br> <br>&#x201c;I was going to step in, in a minute,&#x201d; the man behind them says. He&#x2019;s as thin as fettuccine and wears a peacoat and a muffler. He has kind eyes. Annabelle wants to kiss him. Honestly, she&#x2019;d do more than kiss him. She doesn&#x2019;t care if he hoards bongs or spends his days in his mother&#x2019;s basement, learning guitar. She doesn&#x2019;t care about anything except the offer of safety.<br> <br>All of it&#x2014;the hand, the arm, the vulnerability, the urge to kiss the saving man&#x2014;it crashes like an avalanche. All of the wrongness thunders and falls and threatens to bury her alive. Annabelle wants to be strong, and strong on her own, but she has no idea how. She doesn&#x2019;t want to imagine that some guy can save her, because she knows that&#x2019;s a lie. She doesn&#x2019;t want to feel fear like that, or be paralyzed by it ever again. She wants to rise up, set her gorilla-mean chest right up against the chest of anyone threatening her. She wants to be the kind of woman who says No man will ever and No one messes with me, who banters about the power of her vagina and cutting the dicks off of bullies. Fierce talk. Bold, big, back the fuck off talk.<br> <br>She&#x2019;d like to even just believe talk like that, but she can&#x2019;t. It&#x2019;s not only because of what happened nine months ago. It&#x2019;s about the bigger reality here. A reality that words can&#x2019;t make untrue. She&#x2019;s five foot three. She&#x2019;s a hundred and ten pounds. She&#x2019;s a young woman. History&#x2014;her own, and the world&#x2019;s, years and years ago and just yesterday&#x2014;has told her the truth about the vulnerability of her gender. As a female, her safety, her well-being, and the light she has for the world are still often overlooked and stomped on. That is quite clear.<br> <br>She is also beautiful, which means it&#x2019;s what people see first, and sometimes, the only thing they see, and this is power and weakness both, but mostly weakness, at least so far. And while no one has put a hand on her (this is not that story, though of course for many women it is)&#x2014;she understands something after last year that she wishes she didn&#x2019;t. She understands that when push comes to shove, literally or otherwise, that she must rely on other people being good and doing the right thing. And this, as she knows&#x2014;as she knows very, very well&#x2014;is a terrifying thing to rely on. It&#x2019;s fine most of the time, but at others, it is a thin thread. The thinnest.<br> <br>She feels the thinness of that thread when that man&#x2019;s hand is on her arm, and she realizes there is nowhere for her to go, and nothing she could do, not really, if he decided to harm her. She can&#x2019;t overpower him. All she has is her voice, and even that can seem as helpful as shouting into a hurricane.<br> <br>She is back in that place again, that horrible place, and the fun day is gone, and the happy music is gone, and the hunger is gone, and there is only the need to claw herself from the avalanche and get away. And that is how she finds herself here, at Gene Coulon Park in Renton. Her mind whirled and her feet slapped and slapped the pavement and now she is standing in a parking lot, trying to tell her mother what she is suddenly determined to do.<br> <br>&#x201c;Annabelle!&#x201d; Gina nearly screams. &#x201c;Stop going silent! Tell me what is happening.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not coming home. I&#x2019;m going to run and keep running. I&#x2019;m going to run until I reach Washington, DC.&#x201d; Of course, this is crazy and impossible and doomed, even if she&#x2019;s a long-distance runner and has two marathon medals hanging on the doorknob of her room. It is silly, and dramatic, and naive. Also&#x2014;idealistic. Of course, she has no concept of the realities here. She has no plan. No team. No training. She will fail, fail, fail. But all she can feel at this moment is how much she personally needs this. She needs this so bad.<br> <br>Yes, she is that Annabelle Agnelli.<br> <br>&#x201c;This is PTSD, Annabelle,&#x201d; her mother says. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you remember what Dr. Mann said?

Essential reading for making treatment decisions for your companion.&#x201d; &#x2014;Temple Grandin, author of <i>Animals Make Us Human</i> and <i>Animals in Translation</i> <br><br>The human-animal bond is never stronger or more tender than when your dog&#x2019;s muzzle turns gray and the spring in her step begins to diminish. After spending the better part of a decade or more with this beloved member of your family, making sure your canine friend ages comfortably, contentedly, and well is a natural priority.

For a medium-size dog who weighs between twenty and fifty pounds, yes, that&#x2019;s about right. For a large dog, one who weighs more than ninety pounds, every year of life is closer to the equivalent of about every eight human years. For a small dog under twenty pounds, each year is the equivalent of about six human years. That&#x2019;s why small dogs, on average, live longer than large ones. They "use up" fewer years with each year of life. </p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> If I choose a dog food that says "senior" on the label, I&#x2019;m giving my older dog the nutrition he or she needs, right?</p> <p><strong>A:</strong> Who knows? "Senior" is a marketing term, not a specific nutritional term, so it means whatever the manufacturer wants it to mean. Some "senior" dog foods are high in calories, some are low in calories, and some have a nutrient composition that is not well balanced for all older dogs, with levels of sodium, protein, and other ingredients all over the map. The only way to know if a food is right for your geriatric dog is to make sure there&#x2019;s a sentence on the package that says the food is appropriate for maintenance, not for growth or gestation and lactation.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> If a dog has arthritis, she or he will limp, right?</p> <p><strong>A:</strong> Not necessarily. If the arthritis is in the same spot on both hind legs or both front legs, the dog may waddle or shuffle. That is, the gait will look symmetrical, unlike a limp. But waddling and shuffling are not normal ways of walking, and a dog who is not walking normally should be taken to the vet for an exam.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Why is it that dogs with cancer who are on chemo don&#x2019;t go bald?</p> <p><strong>A:</strong> It&#x2019;s rare for a dog on chemo to lose hair because dogs get lower doses of chemotherapy for their size. In people, the aim with chemo is to try to cure the cancer. In dogs, it&#x2019;s to extend life but not rid the body of the malignancy. Since chemo can be so debilitating, with side effects that include nausea, diarrhea, and infections, and since an older dog with cancer will lose not decades of life but only a few years at most, the veterinary community feels it is not right to put such a dog through a medical regimen that will destroy the quality of life while affording the animal only a few extra months to a couple of years.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Why is it that you never hear of dogs dropping dead of a heart attack?</p> <p><strong> A:</strong> Dogs don&#x2019;t get heart attacks, generally speaking. They get heart failure, a progressive disease that takes its toll over time. Fortunately, much can be done to forestall the effects of heart failure and grant an affected dog several more years of good-quality life.</p> <p></p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> My ten-year-old dog doesn&#x2019;t come when I call him anymore. Is he falling prey to age-related dementia?</p> <p><strong>A:</strong> It&#x2019;s hard to say. He might just be going deaf. Dementia is a bit tricky to diagnose in dogs because they are unable to communicate in words that they don&#x2019;t hear or can&#x2019;t see as well or have other declines that could be mistaken for dementia. <em>Good Old Dog</em> has a checklist with constellations of symptoms that, taken together, indicate when you should take your dog in for a neurological evaluation to see if he has the canine version of Alzheimer&#x2019;s. New methods to treat the disease are emerging, and the sooner your dog is correctly diagnosed, the better chance you have of stalling any cognitive decline.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> A dog will let you know when "it&#x2019;s time" to put him down, right?</p> <p><strong> A:</strong> Not necessarily. Many conditions in older dogs that look like "this is the end" are very treatable. While we believe that euthanizing a dog who is in constant pain and has no quality of life left is a responsible and loving thing to do, you should never make a choice to euthanize without first taking him to the doctor for a professional workup. We&#x2019;ve delivered the good news to many dog owners that, despite their fear, the dog&#x2019;s time has not yet come.</p> <p></p> <p></p>The CUMMINGS SCHOOL OF VETERINARY MEDICINE AT TUFTS UNIVERSITY treats more than 26,000 cases annually, and its emergency critical-care program is the largest residency training program in the United States. <br><br>LAWRENCE LINDNER is a best-selling collaborative author.<br><br>NICHOLAS DODMAN is a world-renowned animal behaviorist, who has appeared on <i>Oprah,</i> the <i>Today</i> show, <i>20/20,</i> and CNN.</p><h2>Take the Cannoli: Stories From the New World</h2><p>A wickedly funny collection of personal essays from popular NPR personality Sarah Vowell.<br><br>Hailed by <i>Newsweek</i> as a "cranky stylist with talent to burn," Vowell has an irresistible voice -- caustic and sympathetic, insightful and double-edged -- that has attracted a loyal following for her magazine writing and radio monologues on <i>This American Life</i>.<br> <br>While tackling subjects such as identity, politics, religion, art, and history, these autobiographical tales are written with a biting humor, placing Vowell solidly in the tradition of Mark Twain and Dorothy Parker. Vowell searches the streets of Hoboken for traces of the town's favorite son, Frank Sinatra. She goes under cover of heavy makeup in an investigation of goth culture, blasts cannonballs into a hillside on a father-daughter outing, and maps her family's haunted history on a road trip down the Trail of Tears.<br> <br><i>Take the Cannoli</i> is an eclectic tour of the New World, a collection of alternately hilarious and heartbreaking essays and autobiographical yarns.</p><p>Sarah Vowell is a contributing editor for public radio's <i>This American Life</i> and has written for <i>Time, Esquire, GQ, Spin, Salon, McSweeneys, The Village Voice,</i> and the <i>Los Angeles Times.</i> She is the author of <i>Radio On, Take the Cannoli,</i> and <i>The Partly Cloudy Patriot.</i> She lives in New York City.Broadcaster and columnist Vowell (Radio On: A Listener's Diary, 1998) presents a wonderfully eclectic mix of smart-witted, often hilarious personal essays. For every reference Vowell makes to The Great Gatsby, Huck Finn, or the Book of Revelations (three of her favorites), she quotes a combination of Sinatra, Elvis, Springsteen, and Johnny Cash a dozen times, resulting in refreshing writing with attitude. Throughout, Vowell's passion for music, sound, and rhythm are manifested in her words and her topics, whether firing a cannon with dad or making a mix tape for a friend's girlfriend. Many of the stylish essays are ``on assignment'' accounts, in which Vowell allows herself to be dressed up for a night of goth clubbing, attends Rock 'n' Roll Fantasy Camp, checks into the grimy and ghostly Chelsea Hotel, and tries to learn to drive at 28. Her title track, ``Take the Cannoli,'' is not about music, but takes its namesake from a sound byte in The Godfathera film Vowell obsessed over when in college. The film's ``made-up, sexist East Coast thugs'' taught Vowell a valuable lesson about family, guns, and dessert. But not everything is sugar-coated in Vowell's world: she claims that ``even as a six-year-old I knew I'd never be good enough to get into heaven,'' and she recounts whining her way through Disney World in ``Species-on-Species Abuse.'' She gets cranky and sardonic, but at these moments her talent may shine brightest. In ``Dark Circles,'' Vowell, coffee in hand, comes to grips with her insomnia: lying awake in bed, she recalls her day, arriving at the less-than-soporific conclusion that ``everyday, no matter how cheerful, how innocuous, always contains within it some little speed bump of anger or hate, some wrong place, wrong time, hell-is-other-people moment of despair. Nighty night.'' Vowell's crafty writing, often free-spirited and sometimes neurotic, is like literary stand-up comedy with a lot of heart and perfect delivery.-- <i>Copyright � 2000 Kirkus Associates, LP.

Luther was a professor of Bible at the University of Wittenberg when he posted his famous 95 Theses (1517). In addition to writing many books, Luther translated the Bible into German. Luther believed that salvation was only by faith in Jesus, unmediated by the church. He challenged papal authority by emphasing the Bible as the only source of religious authority and believed the church to be a priesthood of all believers.These ideas helped to inspire the Protestant Reformation and changed the course of Western civilization. He married Katharina von Bora thus initiating the practice of clerical marriage within Protestantism.- Publisher.</p><h2>Evening Prayers: For Every Day of the Year</h2><p><b>End each day of the year peacefully by turning to God with a prayer and a Bible passage.</b><br><br>We want to turn to God at the end of each day, but often don&#x2019;t find the words to express our deepest feelings and longing.

It is hence often difficult for those with training in Western philosophy who wish to approach this tradition for the first time to know where to start, and difficult for those who wish to introduce and teach courses in Buddhist philosophy to find suitable textbooks that adequately represent the diversity of the tradition, expose students to important primary texts in reliable translations, that contextualize those texts, and that foreground specifically philosophical issues. <br> <br> <em>Buddhist Philosophy</em> fills that lacuna. It collects important philosophical texts from each major Buddhist tradition. Each text is translated and introduced by a recognized authority in Buddhist studies. Each introduction sets the text in context and introduces the philosophical issues it addresses and arguments it presents, providing a useful and authoritative guide to reading and to teaching the text. The volume is organized into topical sections that reflect the way that Western philosophers think about the structure of the discipline, and each section is introduced by an essay explaining Buddhist approaches to that subject matter, and the place of the texts collected in that section in the enterprise. <br> <br> This volume is an ideal single text for an intermediate or advanced course in Buddhist philosophy, and makes this tradition immediately accessible to the philosopher or student versed in Western philosophy coming to Buddhism for the first time. It is also ideal for the scholar or student of Buddhist studies who is interested specifically in the philosophical dimensions of the Buddhist tradition.<br></p><p><br><strong>William Edelglass</strong> is Assistant Professor of Philosophy at Marlboro College.

Lewis once remarked. At times, the music used in worship can make us feel as though the culture is usurping the Church rather than being transfigured by it.

Many before they are even old enough to buy a beer. For me, I had never given serious thought to joining the Navy until after college.<br> <br>Until then, I had what you would call a &#x201c;normal&#x201d; life. I attended high school at Jesuit College Preparatory School of Dallas, followed by college at Southern Methodist University, where I studied finance and economics. During that time I also had the privilege of studying at Oxford University in England, which influenced me to become a writer. When I graduated in 1999, I had already accepted a job as a financial analyst with a global real estate investment company. I accepted the offer just before Christmas break during my senior year, so let&#x2019;s just say my class attendance during that last semester was subpar.<br> <br>One of my fraternity brothers who was a year behind me in school was determined to join the Navy and try out for the SEAL program after he graduated. And so during his senior year, I trained with him. I had played rugby for four years in college, so it was a great way to maintain my fitness and help a friend prepare for a rough journey.<br> <br>As time went on, I became more and more fascinated with the culture and values of the Naval Special Warfare community. I was reading everything I could find, from the earliest history of the Underwater Demolition Teams (UDT) in World War II to operations in Korea, Vietnam, and the Middle East. I was attracted to the idea of challenging myself to become a part of one of the most elite, highest-performance teams in the world.<br> <br>My mindset was transforming.<br> <br>I would sit at my desk on the forty-second floor of a high-rise office building in downtown Dallas, staring out the window, counting the minutes until I could leave and go train with my friend. It&#x2019;s embarrassing to admit, but toward the end of the day I would walk quickly through the office with an empty manila folder, looking busy and focused&#x2014;so I hopefully wouldn&#x2019;t get tasked with a new project at 5:45 p.m. It rarely worked. I was the new guy.<br> <br>Maybe not what an employer is looking for in a star player, but I was becoming fixated on something greater than myself. Each night, I would put on my running shoes, throw on a backpack containing swim fins and goggles and run four miles from my uptown apartment to the SMU pool. We would swim for an hour and do calisthenics such as push-ups, pull-ups, burpees and sit-ups. Then I would run four miles home. On the weekends, we had a strength training regimen followed by running ten to twenty miles around White Rock Lake. We ran marathons and earned our skydiving licenses. Each day our dedication to this singular mission increased.<br> <br>Eventually, I decided to live a life without regret. I quit my job, and my friend and I spent several more months training in the mountains, in Colorado. There would be no hiking or horseback riding on this trip. My parents had a house in the Gold Link neighborhood in Crested Butte, Colorado, which became our training facility. We carved out a training ground in the woods behind the house and suspended thick climbing ropes thirty feet high in the tall cypress trees. We used a chain saw to cut eight-foot logs from fallen trees and would run each day for miles through the mountain passes, carrying them on our shoulders. We&#x2019;d swim in ice-covered lakes and spend hours a day training at 10,000 feet so we&#x2019;d be ready.<br> <br>In 2000, I enlisted in the Navy. Like many SEALs with college degrees, I chose to not attend OCS (Officer Candidacy School) because enlisting was a faster path to BUD/S. During basic training in Great Lakes, Illinois, you take the physical test to qualify for BUD/S. It involves a 500-meter swim, 1.5-mile timed run in boots, push-ups, pull-ups, and sit-ups. Candidates are not expected to simply meet the minimum standards&#x2014;which most don&#x2019;t&#x2014;they are expected to blow them out of the water. I can&#x2019;t remember how many guys tried out that day, but there were many. The swim test began like a flurry of salmon battling to make it upstream. Some couldn&#x2019;t even complete the swim. Limp, exhausted bodies literally being pulled from the pool. It was astonishing. All I remember is that only three of us were sitting in the office that afternoon getting orders to BUD/S. Me, my friend from college and one other guy. The rest of boot camp flew by.<br> <br>We had earned our ticket to the show.<br> <br>After a month of &#x201c;A&#x201d; school (the school teaching you a trade in the Navy, because most won&#x2019;t become SEALs) in San Diego, we were given a couple weeks of leave. I went back to Dallas to mentally prepare for the journey ahead.<br> <br>Two weeks later, I distinctly remember the feeling of anticipation I had as my plane flew over the downtown skyline on its approach into San Diego International Airport. The sun was glistening off the bay and my mind was racing. I remember thinking what a beautiful place this was to endure such misery.<br> <br>I checked in to a hotel on Harbor Drive just a few minutes from the airport that Thursday evening. That would prove to be a sleepless night. The next morning, my buddy and I hopped in a cab and headed to the Naval Special Warfare Center in Coronado to check in. Driving over the Coronado Bridge felt like the point of no return. I had heard rumors that instructors would make you &#x201c;hit the surf&#x201d; and get wet, sandy, and miserable as soon as you arrived. So it seemed it would prove to be an interesting morning.<br> <br>The journey had begun&#x2014;or so we thought.<br> <br>We walked into the lobby and approached the front desk. Behind it sat two clean-cut young gentlemen. Clearly, early-stage BUD/S students standing &#x201c;watch&#x201d; on the quarterdeck. Apparently, it was a holiday weekend, so they told us to come back on Tuesday! It was both a relief and a bit anticlimactic. We held up in a dingy but rather expensive motel down the street for the next few days&#x2014;dreaming of the impending doom ahead.<br> <br>So, as destiny dictated, a couple of fraternity brothers from SMU joined BUD/S class 235 in the fall of 2000. Of all the adventures and challenges I would end up experiencing as a SEAL, I remember those days at the beginning of BUD/S vividly.<br> <br>I can still picture the other guys filtering in, and the experience of everybody sizing each other up. We all knew that only a small percentage of people would end up getting through. We were strangers, but at the end of it, a small group of us would be blood brothers, forever.<br> <br>Hollywood generally portrays SEALS in one way&#x2014;big, ripped guys who look like they just walked off the football field or climbed out of an Olympic swimming pool. But the reality is that nobody looking at a BUD/S class on the first day can really tell who will still be standing at the end. Some of the biggest and fittest guys&#x2014;ones who looked like they came off a recruiting poster&#x2014;were the ones who placed their green helmets on the ground and rang the bell to give up on the first day&#x2014;the formal and humbling ceremony for those that quit. Recruits who were unbelievable swimmers and runners quit the first week, or the first day of Hell Week&#x2014;the relentless torture chamber that organically separates the candidates who can push through physical and psychological pain from those who can&#x2019;t.<br> <br>Everything about SEAL training is designed to test your mental and physical fortitude, and see how you can adapt to constantly changing conditions. Each class is divided into &#x201c;boat crews&#x201d; consisting of six enlisted students and one officer. As candidates would quit, boat crews would get rearranged. You were constantly building and rebuilding your team and adapting to new teammates&#x2014;and they to you.<br> <br>The culture taught us that change was a given, and that the strongest embraced change and used it to their advantage.<br> <br>I made it through BUD/S without incident or any severe injuries and was preparing to begin SQT (SEAL Qualification Training&#x2014;the advanced portion of the training pipeline). The attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon on September 11, 2001, occurred just days before we checked in to SQT. In the space of a few hours, we went from being a peacetime force to an organization constantly preparing for and executing missions all over the world. To being in a constant state of change.<br> <br>I&#x2019;ve seen and done things I will never forget, though my contribution pales in comparison to so many. When I finished my time as a SEAL, I decided I wanted to merge my special operations experience with &#x201c;real world&#x201d; education to start the next phase of my life&#x2014;as an entrepreneur. While attending graduate school at the University of San Diego, I launched my first company.<br> <br>As I was building that business, I read every book and watched every presentation I could find on leadership, organizational development, culture and business transformation&#x2014;all tools I knew I would need. And I dove deep into the literature and reports produced by the top consulting firms that companies hire to help them solve their complicated strategic problems. There was clearly no shortage of awareness and willingness on the part of organizational leaders, and there were plenty of resources. But clearly, navigating growth and change wasn&#x2019;t easy.<br> <br>So why do so many organizations fall significantly short of realizing their potential?<br> <br>The numbers are grim.<br> <br>Research shows that more than two-thirds of all significant organizational transformation efforts fail or fall short of meeting the intended objectives. Companies try every day to fix cultural problems, change their target markets, revise their product mixes, adapt to new competitive challenges, and undertake dozens of other transformative steps. You&#x2019;ve heard about the success stories, like Apple and Amazon. But the failures outnumber them exponentially.<br> <br>I built my own organizations on the premise that change was a natural part of the business cycle&#x2014;and that hiring, training, communicating, engaging, measuring, and rewarding in a way that reinforced that principle was the best way to produce the desired culture and results. The success of that approach is reflected by the results&#x2014;building some of the fastest-growing companies in the country. But it hasn&#x2019;t been easy or void of major challenges.<br> <br>One of the first valuable principles you learn after joining a SEAL Team is how the team learns from its successes and failures. After every mission, the team conducts an AAR (after-action review)&#x2014;a post mortem debrief where we analyze performance and results. Lessons learned are applied to the operating strategy. When the data supports the potential need for a shift in tactics, that information is disseminated quickly across the organization.<br> <br>Between my time in the Teams, in academia, and in the business world, I&#x2019;ve spent almost twenty years figuring out what works and what doesn&#x2019;t&#x2014;and how transformations can succeed and last. And why they fail.<br> <br>The result is a ten-principle model, TakingPoint, that is the only guide of its kind. It is a step-by-step playbook for surviving and thriving in the uncertain business landscape of the twenty-first century. The strategies we&#x2019;re going to talk about are the same ones I share with my consulting clients like PayPal, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Boeing, Nestl�, Care Fusion, The North Face, and Raytheon. They&#x2019;re the principles that have transformed the special operations community in this post-9/11 reality. And they have helped Fortune 500 companies overcome what seem to be almost insurmountable challenges.<br> <br>When a SEAL platoon is on a mission, the man in front is the point man&#x2014;he&#x2019;s &#x201c;taking point&#x201d;&#x2014;leading the team into what are almost always volatile, complex, and unpredictable situations. My goal with this book is to give anybody the tools to take point in their own organization and the ability to vigorously lead change, not just manage it.<br> <br>This matters wherever you fall on your org chart.<br> <br>Why?<br> <br>In large part, most organizational change efforts fail because they happen in overmanaged, under-led command-and-control environments. The existing structures and culture impede forward progress. In overmanaged companies, when leadership sees a crisis looming, knee-jerk reactions can often become the norm&#x2014;making uninformed decisions and giving different orders to different groups of people. And while many might be under the misconception that all military units operate in command-and-control environments, that&#x2019;s not the case. In special operations, we have made a diligent effort to decentralize controls and decision-making mechanisms. Varying leadership responsibilities are disseminated down the chain of command.<br> <br>Lasting and productive change is certainly led from the top, but it works because the entire ecosystem is operating with the appropriate and aligned mindset. All hands are on the rope pulling in the same direction. It is a collective process that takes buy-in, engagement and contribution from everybody. You have to learn to master your role&#x2014;whether you&#x2019;re the Team&#x2019;s commanding officer, platoon leader, or the frontline soldier.<br> <br>We will build that mindset together. It will take discipline and accountability, and some parts of the process will cause discomfort. As we say in the SEAL Teams, we will all have to &#x201c;get comfortable being uncomfortable.&#x201d; I know this from my own career as a leader of organizations that had the inevitable growing pains that all companies experience. It isn&#x2019;t as easy as flipping a few pages and giving yourself a pep talk.<br> <br>But at the end of this journey, your business &#x201c;kit bag&#x201d; will have the tools and weapons you will need to step confidently onto the business battlefield of change. You&#x2019;ll be more ready for the job we&#x2019;re all going to have for better or worse in the modern economy.<br> <br>Change agent.</p><h2>The Enochian Evocation of Dr. John Dee</h2><p>Based on the transcriptions of Dr. John Dee, the famous Elizabethan scientist and magus, The Enochian Evocation of Dr. John Dee is the translation of the original material received from direct Angelic contact. In 1852 Dee and his partner Edward Kelly, while gazing into a crystal stone, began to see and hear angels. These beings desired to re-establish the true art of magic, which had been lost due to man&#39;s wickedness and ignorance. The true magical art, these beings claimed, would bestow superhuman powers upon its practitioners, change the political structure of Europe, and herald the coming of the Apocalypse. Dee believed this research would greatly benefit mankind and documented all of the channeled information into a series of manuscripts and workbooks. Author Geoffrey James presents here the direct translation of the core of the channeled material itself, framed in a historical context, with authority and integrity.</p><p>Based on the transcriptions of Dr. John Dee, the famous Elizabethan scientist and magus, The Enochian Evocation of Dr. John Dee is the translation of the original material received from direct Angelic contact.

Two million visitors annually now walk the paved streets which re-emerged, miraculously preserved, from their layers of volcanic ash. Yet for all the fame and unique importance of the site, there is a surprising lack of a handy archaeological guide in English to reveal and explain its public spaces and private residences. This compact and user-friendly handbook, written by an expert in the field, helpfully fills that gap. Illustrated throughout with maps, plans, diagrams and other images, Pompeii: An Archaeological Guide offers a general introduction to the doomed city followed by an authoritative summary and survey of the buildings, artefacts and paintings themselves. The result is an unrivalled picture, derived from an intimate knowledge of Roman archaeology around the Bay of Naples, of the forum, temples, brothels, bath-houses, bakeries, gymnasia, amphitheatre, necropolis and other site buildings - including perennial favourites like the House of the Faun, named after its celebrated dancing satyr.</p><p>Paul Wilkinson founded the Kent Archaeological Field School (www.kafs.co.uk), is currently Director of the Swale and Thames Archaeological Survey Company - or SWAT Archaeology for short (www.swatarchaeology.co.uk) - and holds a PhD in archaeology from the University of St Andrews. His previous books include the bestselling Pompeii: The Last Day (2004) and Archaeology: What it is, Where it is, and How to do it (2007), which have each sold well in excess of 50,000 copies.</p><h2>Murder at the Brightwell: The First Amory Ames Mystery (An Amory Ames Mystery, 1)</h2><p><p><b>Shortlisted for the Edgar Awards</b></p><p><b>Ashley Weaver&#x2019;s debut mystery, <i>Murder at the Brightwell</i>, is a delicious, stylish novel in which murder invades British polite society and romance springs in unexpected places, and a wonderful testament to the enduring delight of the traditional mystery.</b></p><p><b>&#x201c;An elegant Christie-esque 1930s romp.&#x201d; &#x2015;Deborah Crombie</b></p><p><b>&#x201c;If you love Downton Abbey, you'll adore Ashley Weaver&#x2019;s charming debut.&#x201d;&#x2015;Susan Elia MacNeal</b></p><p><i>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s more terrible than you think, Mrs. Ames.

For sixty years, Monroe was a star at the Grand Ole Opry, and when he died in 1996, he was universally hailed as "the Father of Bluegrass." But the personal life of this taciturn figure remained largely unknown. Delving into everything from Monroe's professional successes to his bitter rivalries, from his isolated childhood to his reckless womanizing, veteran bluegrass journalist Richard D. Smith has created a three-dimensional portrait of this brilliant, complex, and contradictory man. Featuring over 120 interviews, this scrupulously researched work&#x2014;a <i>Chicago Tribune</i> Choice Selection, <i>New York Times</i> Notable Book, and <i>Los Angeles Times</i> Best Book of 2000&#x2014;stands as the authoritative biography of a true giant of American music.</p><p>The legendary mandolinist and bandleader Bill Monroe wove his personal vision through more than 60 tireless years of recording and performing, inventing almost single-handedly the music that is now known--in a nod to his first band, the Blue Grass Boys--as bluegrass. In his thoughtful biography <i>Can't You Hear Me Callin'</i>, Richard D. Smith argues that "no single artist has had as broad an impact on American music." As evidence, he highlights dozens of country and rock &amp; roll musicians, both white and black, who were inspired by Monroe's powerful mandolin playing on the Grand Ole Opry's weekly broadcasts. (Chuck Berry's "Maybelline," for example, is an almost note-for-note copy of Monroe's instrumental "Ida Red.") Until now, however, Monroe's hesitation to reveal personal details has kept his personality as mysterious as one of the foggy mountaintops he sang about in his signature high lonesome tenor. <p> Bluegrass audiences required a rural, Southern authenticity from the "Father of Bluegrass," and Monroe was slow to deny their exaggerations. Smith, however, dismisses many of the backwoodsy stories that grew up around the Monroe myth, instead emphasizing truer biographical elements: loneliness, fear of abandonment, compulsiveness with women. Perhaps the book's main scholarly step forward is the depth of interviews and research the author conducted with the women in Monroe's life. Indeed, Smith remarks that "without exception," none of Monroe's platonic or romantic women friends had been interviewed before. These women reveal a second Bill Monroe, relaxed and gentle in private despite his imperious manner onstage.</p><p> Much of the book relies on the archives of the late Ralph Rinzler, a Smithsonian folklorist whose plans to write a Monroe biography were thwarted by his untimely death. Taking up where Rinzler left off, Smith employs solid scholarship and thorough fieldwork, yet he remains clearly in awe of his subject, ranking him as a "true giant of American music" on the level of Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong, Hank Williams, and Charles Ives. <i>Can't You Hear Me Callin'</i> is the first published attempt at a comprehensive, critical biography of Bill Monroe. Surely, it won't be the last--a testament to the enigmatic genius whose every note extended one of our most emotive and demanding musical genres. <i>--Edward Skoog</i></p><b>Richard D.

Even a privilege. Yet five minutes after class ended, Abigail Turner remained frozen at her desk. A school project worth twenty-five percent of her grade tied to her greatest fear? And one that had to be developed and completed before the holidays? The professor called it a simple way to overcome the past by focusing on the future. A way to explore the principles they&#x2019;d discussed and apply them to their own lives before trying the ideas on future clients. Didn&#x2019;t he see how tied the two were? How there was nothing simple about confronting dark moments in the past that were best avoided?<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Abigail pushed back from the desk and joined the last students streaming through the door to the hall. She didn&#x2019;t notice anyone else who had broken into a cold sweat at the professor&#x2019;s instructions. In fact, most joked and bantered like another week of school was almost over, leading to another weekend of studying, Purdue football, and any odd jobs they worked. Maybe her fellow students didn&#x2019;t carry the fears and weight of the past as tightly as she did. <br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>She tried to shake it off as she&#x2019;d done over the years. She still had weeks to create the right experience for the project&#x2014;at least until the end of the semester. Professor Plante had even made it sound like the students could have longer if they didn&#x2019;t mind an incomplete on their transcript.<br>&nbsp;<br>As Abigail entered the hallway of Purdue&#x2019;s University Hall, she froze. The October wind gusted through the door and toyed with her hat, but that didn&#x2019;t account for her inability to move. No, she could only blame that on the reality that if she was truly to do this assignment, she had to find a way to open her heart to someone else. How could she make Professor Plante or anyone else understand that she couldn&#x2019;t do that? Not when it risked someone else leaving her.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I have to get to work.&#x201d; She whispered the words as she tightened her grip on her bag, which was loaded down with textbooks, then forced her legs to move.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>What would her life be like if Sam Troy, her high school love, hadn&#x2019;t enlisted and then died that terrible day the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor? With his death, her carefully constructed dreams for the future crashed into an abyss, one she couldn&#x2019;t seem to climb from.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>She glanced at her watch and frowned. If she dawdled any more, she&#x2019;d miss the bus that would carry her down the hill, across the Wabash River, and to downtown Lafayette in time for her shift at Glatz Candies. With the weekend approaching, she looked forward to a couple of days to concentrate on the confections that made the restaurant and candy shop known around town. Soon she&#x2019;d learn the secret to making the popular candy canes. Maybe she could coax the owner into teaching her the tricks to the twisted sweet that night.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Slow down, Abigail.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Abigail grinned as her classmate Laurie Bertsche hurried up, her polo coat buttoned to her throat. <br>Abigail nudged her friend in the shoulder. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not cold enough for that coat yet.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m from Florida. We don&#x2019;t do cold.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Then why pick Purdue?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;It picked me, since it was as far away from home as I could afford.&#x201d; Laurie shuddered and gripped the coat around her throat. &#x201c;What do you think of that assignment?&#x201d; She rushed on before Abigail could interrupt. &#x201c;It should be fun to think of something. There are so many people who need help.&#x201d; Laurie paused, frowned for a moment, then shrugged. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sure what I&#x2019;ll do yet. Do you have ideas?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Not yet.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re so intense; I know you&#x2019;ll come up with something brilliant.&#x201d; Merriment danced in Laurie&#x2019;s green eyes. &#x201c;I need a favor tomorrow night. One of the guys I know from town asked me to a movie and dance. I said yes, but the problem is he has a buddy. Say you&#x2019;ll join us.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;You know my stance on boys.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Laurie singsonged as they waltzed through the doors. &#x201c;No dating until this war business is over.&#x201d; She paused and a serious glint entered her expression. &#x201c;This isn&#x2019;t a boy like you&#x2019;d see here. He&#x2019;s not a student, but a man supporting his family.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t, Laurie. If he&#x2019;s not in the military yet, he will be any day. Life is too uncertain to risk even friendship.&#x201d; Abigail had certainly learned that lesson between Sam, her brother Alfie, and her sister Annie. Professor Plante wanted her to confront her fears by acting in opposition to those very fears that life had branded into her. How could she do something and then write an essay explaining how the action had changed her? What if she did something and found she was still afraid of losing someone she loved? Should she help the military boys in some way? Or should she focus on children? Would either satisfy her professor?<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;You mean you <i>won&#x2019;t. </i>I intend to have a great time with Joey, but I wish you&#x2019;d come. Joey&#x2019;s friend seems nice, and you don&#x2019;t need to worry that it will be for more than one night. Now if something develops with Joey, that&#x2019;s just icing for me.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Try ice on the Wabash,&#x201d; Abigail mumbled. &#x201c;The kind you fall through.&#x201d; The kind that broke your heart into shattered pieces, like the fragile ice coating the wide river, and left you frozen inside when you fell into the cold current.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Laurie shook her head. &#x201c;Too early for that kind of ice. I&#x2019;ll have enough fun for the two of us. Call if you change your mind. If not, I&#x2019;ll see you in class Monday.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>The rumble of the bus on State Street warned Abigail she&#x2019;d better hurry.<br><i>&nbsp;</i><br><i>&nbsp;</i><br><i>Don&#x2019;t leave! I can&#x2019;t be late for work.</i><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>She waved frantically as the driver shifted the bus into gear. She rushed into State Street, waving. Brakes screeched and someone tugged her back to the curb right before a car whizzed by, horn blaring. Her heart stuttered in her chest. She&#x2019;d come too close to landing under the wheels of that car.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;You all right, miss?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Thanks to you.&#x201d; She turned to her rescuer, and his gaze captured her, a mix of sadness and concern swirling in his eyes.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;You coming? Or standing out there all day?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Heat flooded Abigail&#x2019;s cheeks at the bus driver&#x2019;s barked words. After checking for traffic, she hurried across the street, then tripped up the stairs, thrust a token into the box, and stepped down the aisle, barely noticing the young man who had rescued her following with a slight limp. The grinding gears and the bus&#x2019;s accompanying lurch pushed her down the aisle, and she<br>collapsed onto an empty seat. The young man took the one opposite her.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>She glanced at him under her lashes, noting the broad shoulders that indicated a life of work. There was something about him, as if his dog had just died, that made her want to reach out.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>He slouched in his seat, hands clasped in his lap, shoulders slumped forward. A hat was crammed on top of dark hair that curled at the nape of his neck, longer than the regulation cuts worn by enlisted men. There was something familiar about him, yet she was certain they&#x2019;d never been introduced. Abigail shrugged off the feeling. Even in the United States&#x2019; heightened war machine during 1942, Purdue&#x2019;s campus flowed with men. The difference was many wore a uniform. This one didn&#x2019;t. Why? Could it be whatever had caused his limp?<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>His glance rose, colliding with hers. Caught. He&#x2019;d discovered her staring. Still she couldn&#x2019;t look away, not when such uncertainty resided in the pools of his hazel eyes. Something inside her froze, caught between wanting to help and distancing herself from the pain she saw reflected in the depths of his gaze.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Maybe the pain was what she recognized.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>She swallowed around a sudden tightness in her throat. &#x201c;Thank you for what you did out there.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re welcome.&#x201d; His deep voice made it sound like it was nothing. He simply took heroic actions every day.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m Abigail. Abigail Turner.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Jackson Lucas.&#x201d; He looked back down at his hands.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Abigail felt the chill of the disconnection. She yanked a psychology text from the bag at her feet and opened it to the next chapter. The short ride would be better used preparing for Monday&#x2019;s class than wondering about the man seated across the aisle from her. <br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Her vow to avoid romantic relationships, no matter how casual, had not been some fly-by-night decision. She had carefully considered her course after Sam&#x2019;s death.<br>&nbsp;<br><b><i>***<br><br>I&#x2019;ll Be Home for Christmas </i></b><br><b>by Sarah Sundin</b><br>Excerpted from<i> Where Treetops Glisten </i>by Tricia Goyer, Cara Putman, and Sarah Sundin<br><i><br>Friday, December 3, 1943</i><br><i>Lafayette, Indiana</i><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Grace Kessler poked harder at the typewriter keys, trying to drown out the song. Her fingers betrayed her and tapped to the rhythm. Why did Ruby Schmidt insist on singing in the secretarial pool? Why did she have to choose Christmas songs? And couldn&#x2019;t she at least pick a song with a faster beat?<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Grace deciphered her shorthand notes on the spiral-bound tablet to her right and finished a business letter from Mr. Dubois in Alcoa&#x2019;s procurement department to Mr. Parkhurst with the War Production Board. She zipped the letter out of the typewriter, removed the carbon paper, and laid the original in her outgoing basket and the copy in the file basket.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Alcoa was America&#x2019;s top producer of aluminum, crucial for the production of airplanes and other defense materials. A secretary&#x2019;s work might not be as glamorous as a nurse or a WAVE or a Rosie the Riveter, but it allowed Grace to support both her daughter and the war effort.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Grace&#x2019;s gaze slid to the silver picture frame on her desk, which held the last photo taken of George and Linnie together, over two years earlier. Linnie had just turned four. She sat on George&#x2019;s lap, and father and daughter grinned at each other with total adoration. No little girl could have loved her daddy more. <br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Pain rose in Grace&#x2019;s heart, and she ripped her attention back to the typewriter. The faster she typed, the faster Alcoa could produce aluminum, the faster planes could come off the assembly line, and the sooner this war would be over and no more men would be shot down by Japanese bullets over Filipino jungles.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>They never even found George&#x2019;s body.<br><i>&nbsp;</i><br><i>&nbsp;</i><br><i>&#x201c;I&#x2019; ll be home for Christmas . . .&#x201d; </i>Ruby&#x2019;s song drifted closer.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Grace winced. No, he wouldn&#x2019;t.<br>&nbsp;<br>Something scratched the top of Grace&#x2019;s head, and Ruby giggled. <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Ouch.&#x201d; Grace extracted a little leafy branch from her hairdo&#x2014;and a couple strands of her own dark brown hair.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Mistletoe, sweetie.&#x201d; Ruby puckered lips as red as holly berries. &#x201c;You need some Christmas spirit.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Grace replaced a bobby pin and forced herself to smile and wink at Ruby. &#x201c;I need to get back to work, and so do you.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Ruby fluffed her platinum hair. &#x201c;You need a date in the worst possible way. Bobby knows the nicest young man&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d; Grace pinned her strongest look on the girl. &#x201c;No blind dates. Besides, who in this town would agree to baby-sit Linnie?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s a handful, isn&#x2019;t she?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Yes, she is.&#x201d; Grace rolled new paper into her typewriter, flipped the release lever, and aligned the sheet. &#x201c;You&#x2019;d best get back to work before Norton sees you.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Sure enough, the door to the supervisor&#x2019;s office swung open. Grace swept the mistletoe into her lap and handed a blank piece of paper to Ruby. &#x201c;Thank you for taking care of this, Miss Schmidt.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re welcome, Mrs. Kessler.&#x201d; Ruby skedaddled back to her desk.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Mrs. Kessler.&#x201d; Mrs. Norton glared at Grace. &#x201c;Phone call. Your baby-sitter.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Sympathetic murmurs rose from the other secretaries, but Grace&#x2019;s lips and fingertips went numb. Not again.<br>&nbsp;<br>Somehow she stood. She hid the mistletoe in the hip pocket of her bottle-green suit jacket and walked on wobbly ankles down the aisle between all the clattering typewriters.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Thank you, Mrs. Norton.&#x201d; She edged past her matronly supervisor and through the doorway to the office.<br>&nbsp;<br>Mrs. Norton crossed her plump arms. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re the only one, Mrs. Kessler. The only one who takes so many personal calls. You need to get a handle on that child of yours.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Yes ma&#x2019;am.&#x201d; Grace turned her back on her supervisor to hide her anguish, and she picked up the receiver. &#x201c;Mrs. Harrison?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve had it. I&#x2019;ve had it up to here.&#x201d; The baby-sitter&#x2019;s voice climbed and shivered. &#x201c;When she&#x2019;s here . . . oh, my nerves! And when she goes wandering, well, just how much can a woman take?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Grace clenched the cold black receiver. &#x201c;Is Linnie there?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Of course not. She&#x2019;s trying to kill me, I&#x2019;m sure of it.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Inside Grace, frustration with Mrs. Harrison wrestled with worry for Linnie. The clock read 4:05. Linnie should have arrived half an hour earlier. Teaching her daughter how to ride the bus had been necessary when Linnie started school in September, but it only encouraged her wandering. Her searching.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Mrs. Harrison jabbered about her nerves, and guilt filled Grace. What kind of mother allowed her six-year-old daughter to roam the city alone?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Excuse me, Mrs. Harrison. I need to call the police.&#x201d; Again.<br>&#x201c;This is it. This is the last time. I simply cannot take it any longer. I quit.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Outside the tiny office window, Alcoa&#x2019;s red brick smokestack jutted into the gray sky. Grace laid down the receiver, missed, and finally settled it in place.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Mrs. Norton sniffed. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t even think about asking to get off early.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I know, ma&#x2019;am.&#x201d; Grace&#x2019;s voice came out choked. &#x201c;May I make another call, please?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I ought to charge you.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Grace dialed 4045 for the Lafayette Police Department, a number she knew by heart. While the phone rang, she rubbed the aching knot at the base of her skull. <i>Lord, please keep my baby safe.</i><br>So many horrible things could happen to her little girl. And her job. She&#x2019;d worn out every available baby-sitter. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>How could she stay employed without a baby-sitter?

Each novel in this wholly addictive, entirely magical series, set in Sicily and starring a detective unlike any other in crime fiction, blasts the brain like a shot of pure oxygen. Aglow with local color, packed with flint-dry wit, as fresh and clean as Mediterranean seafood &#x2014; altogether transporting. Long live Camilleri, and long live Montalbano.&#x201d; A.J. Finn, #1&nbsp;</b></b><i><b><b><i>New York Times</i></b></b></i><b><b>&nbsp;bestselling author of&nbsp;</b></b><i><b><b><i>The Woman in the Window</i></b></b></i></b><br><br>Andrea Camilleri's Inspector Montalbano has garnered millions of fans worldwide with his sardonic take on Sicilian life. Montalbano's latest case begins with a mysterious t�t� � t�t� with a Mafioso, some inexplicably abandoned loot from a supermarket heist, and dying words that lead him to an illegal arms cache in a mountain cave. There, the inspector finds two young lovers, dead for fifty years and still embracing, watched over by a life-sized terra-cotta dog. Montalbano's passion to solve this old crime takes him on a journey through Sicily's past and into one family's darkest secrets. With sly wit and a keen understanding of human nature, Montalbano is a detective whose earthiness, compassion, and imagination make him totally irresistable.</p><p>Andrea Camilleri's Montalbano mystery series, bestsellers in Italy and Germany, has been adapted for Italian television and translated into German, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Greek, Japanese, Dutch, and Swedish. He lives in Rome.<br>Stephen Sartarelli lives in upstate New York.To judge from the entrance the dawn was making, it promised to be a very iffy day&#x2014;that is, blasts of angry sunlight one minute, fits of freezing rain the next, all of it seasoned with sudden gusts of wind&#x2014;one of those days when someone who is sensitive to abrupt shifts in weather and suffers them in his blood and brain is likely to change opinion and direction continuously, like those sheets of tin, cut in the shape of banners and roosters, that spin every which way on rooftops with each new puff of wind.<p>Inspector Salvo Montalbano had always belonged to this unhappy category of humanity. It was something passed on to him by his mother, a sickly woman who used to shut herself up in her bedroom, in the dark, whenever she had a headache, and when this happened one could make no noise about the house and had to tread lightly. His father, on the other hand, on stormy seas and smooth, always maintained an even keel, always the same unchanging state of mind, rain or shine.</p><p>This time, too, the inspector did not fail to live up to his inborn nature. No sooner had he stopped his car at the ten-kilometer marker along the Vig�ta-Fela highway, as he had been told to do, than he felt like putting it back in gear and returning to town, bagging the whole operation. He managed to control himself, brought the car closer to the edge of the road, opened the glove compartment, and reached for the pistol he normally did not carry on his person. His hand, however, remained poised in midair: immobile, spellbound, he stared at the weapon.</p><p>Good God! It's real! he thought.</p><p>The previous evening, a few hours before Geg� Gullotta called to set up the whole mess-Geg� being a small-time dealer of soft drugs and the manager of an open-air bordello known as "the Pasture"-the inspector had been reading a detective novel by a writer from Barcelona who greatly intrigued him and had the same surname as he, though hispanicized: Montalb�n. One sentence in particular had struck him: "The pistol slept, looking like a cold lizard." He withdrew his hand with a slight feeling of disgust and closed the glove compartment, leaving the lizard to its slumber. After all, if the whole business that was about to unfold turned out to be a trap, an ambush, he could carry all the pistols he wanted, and still they would fill him with holes with their Kalishnikovs however and whenever they so desired, thank you and good night. He could only hope that Geg�, remembering the years they'd spent together on the same bench in elementary school and the friendship they'd carried over into adulthood, had not decided, out of self-interest, to sell him like pork at the market, feeding him any old bullshit just to lead him to the slaughter. No, not just any old bullshit: this business, if for real, could be really big, make a lot of noise.</p><p>He sighed deeply and began to make his way slowly, step by step, up a narrow, rocky path between broad expanses of vineyard. The vines bore table grapes, with round, firm seeds, the kind called, who knows why, "Italian grapes," the only kind that would take in this soil. As for trying to grow vines for making wine, in this soil you were better off sparing yourself the labor and expense.</p><p>The two-story cottage, one room on top of another, was at the summit of the hill, half-hidden by four large Saracen olive trees that nearly surrounded it. It was just as Geg� had described it. Faded, shuttered windows and door, a huge caper bush in front, with some smaller shrubs of touch-me-not-the small, wild cucumber that squirts seeds into the air if you touch it with the tip of a stick-a collapsed wicker chair turned upside down, an old zinc bucket eaten up by rust and now useless. Grass had overgrown everything else. It all conspired to give the impression that the place had been uninhabited for years, but this appearance was deceptive, and experience had made Montalbano too savvy to be fooled. In fact he was convinced that somebody was eyeing him from inside the cottage, trying to guess his intentions from the moves he would make. He stopped three steps in front of the house, took off his jacket, and hung it from a branch of the olive tree so they could see he wasn't armed. Then he called out without raising his voice much, like a friend come to visit a friend.</p><p>"Hey! Anybody home?"</p><p>No answer, not a sound. Montalbano pulled a lighter and a pack of cigarettes from his trouser pocket, put one in his mouth, and lit it, turning round halfway to shelter himself from the wind. That way whoever was inside the house could examine him from behind, having already examined him from the front. He took two puffs, then went to the door and knocked with his fist, hard enough to hurt his knuckles on the crusts of paint on the wood.</p><p>"Is there anyone here?" he asked again.</p><p>He was ready for anything, except the calm, ironic voice that surprised him from behind.</p><p>"Sure there is. Over here."</p><p>*</p><p>It had all started with a phone call.</p><p>"Hello? Hello? Montalbano! Salvuzzo! It's me, Geg�."</p><p>"I know it's you. Calm down. How are you, my little honey-eyed orange blossom?"</p><p>"I'm fine."</p><p>"Working the mouth hard these days? Been perfecting your blow-job techniques?"</p><p>"Come on, Salv�, don't start with your usual faggot stuff. You know damn well that I don't work myself. I only make other mouths work for me."</p><p>"But aren't you the instructor? Aren't you the one who teaches your multicolored assortment of whores how to hold their lips and how hard to suck?"</p><p>"Salv�, even if what you're saying was true, they'd be the ones teaching me. They come to me at age ten already well-trained, and at fifteen they're top-of-the-line professionals. I've got a little Albanian fourteen-year-old-"</p><p>"You trying to sell me your merchandise now?"</p><p>"Listen, I got no time to fuck around. I have something I'm supposed to give you, a package."</p><p>"At this hour? Can't you get it to me tomorrow morning?"</p><p>"I won't be in town tomorrow."</p><p>"Do you know what's in the package?"</p><p>"Of course. Mostaccioli with mulled wine, the way you like 'em. My sister Mariannina made them just for you."</p><p>"How's Mariannina doing with her eyes?"</p><p>"Much better. They work miracles in Barcelona."</p><p>"They also write good books in Barcelona."</p><p>"What's that?"</p><p>"Never mind. Just talking to myself. Where do you want to meet?"</p><p>"The usual place, in an hour."</p><p>*</p><p>The usual place was the little beach of Puntasecca, a short tongue of sand beneath a white marl hill, almost inaccessible by land, or rather, accessible only to Montalbano and Geg�, who back in grade school had discovered a trail that was difficult enough on foot and downright foolhardy to attempt by car. Puntasecca was only a few kilometers from Montalbano's little house by the sea just outside of Vig�ta, and that was why he took his time. But the moment he opened the door to go to his rendezvous, the telephone rang.</p><p>"Hi, darling. It's me, right on time. How did things go today?"</p><p>"Business as usual. And you?"</p><p>"Ditto. Listen, Salvo, I've been thinking long and hard about what-"</p><p>"Livia, sorry to interrupt, but I haven't got much time. Actually I don't have any time at all. You caught me just as I was going out the door."</p><p>"All right then, good night."</p><p>Livia hung up and Montalbano was left standing with the receiver in his hand. Then he remembered that the night before, he had told her to call him at midnight on the dot, because they would certainly have as much time as they wanted to talk at that hour. He couldn't decide whether to call Livia back right then or when he returned, after his meeting with Geg�. With a pang of remorse, he put the receiver down and went out.</p><p>*</p><p>When he arrived a few minutes late, Geg� was already waiting for him, pacing back and forth the length of his car. They exchanged an embrace and kissed; it had been a while since they'd seen each other.</p><p>"Let's go sit in my car," said the inspector, "it's a little chilly tonight."</p><p>"They put me up to this," Geg� broke in as soon as he sat down.</p><p>"Who did?"</p><p>"Some people I can't say no to. You know, Salv�, like every businessman, I gotta pay my dues so I can work in peace and keep the Pasture, or they'd put me out to pasture in a hurry. Every month the good Lord sends our way, somebody comes by to collect."</p><p>"For whom? Can you tell me?"</p><p>"For Tano the Greek."</p><p>Montalbano shuddered, but didn't let his friend notice. Gaetano "the Greek" Bennici had never so much as seen Greece, not even through a telescope, and knew as much about things Hellenic as a cast-iron pipe, but he came by his nickname owing to a certain vice thought in the popular imagination to be greatly appreciated in the vicinity of the Acropolis. He had three certain murders under his belt, and in his circles held a position one step below the top bosses. But he was not known to operate in or around Vig�ta; it was the Cuffaro and Sinagra families who competed for that territory. Tano belonged to another parish.</p><p>"So what's Tano the Greek's business in these parts?"</p><p>"What kind of stupid question is that? What kind of fucking cop are you? Don't you know that for Tano the Greek there's no such thing as 'these parts' and 'those parts' when it comes to women? He was given control and a piece of every whore on the island."</p><p>"I didn't know. Go on."</p><p>"Around eight o'clock this evening the usual guy came by to collect; today was the appointed day for paying dues. He took the money, but then, instead of leaving, he opens his car door and tells me to get in."</p><p>"So what'd you do?"</p><p>"I got scared and broke out in a cold sweat. What could I do? I got in, and we drove off. To make a long story short, he took the road for Fela, and stopped after barely half an hour's drive . . ."</p><p>"Did you ask him where you were going?"</p><p>"Of course."</p><p>"And what did he say?"</p><p>"Nothing, as if I hadn't spoken. After half an hour, he makes me get out in some deserted spot without a soul around, and gestures to me to follow some dirt road. There wasn't even a dog around. At a certain point, and I have no idea where he popped out of, Tano the Greek suddenly appears in front of me. I nearly had a stroke, my knees turned to butter. Don't get me wrong, I'm no coward, but the guy's killed five people."</p><p>"Five?"</p><p>"Why, how many do you think he's killed?"</p><p>"Three."</p><p>"No way, it's five, I guarantee it."</p><p>"Okay, go on."</p><p>"I got to thinking. Since I always pay on time, I figured Tano wanted to raise the price. Business is good, I got no complaints, and they know it. But I was wrong, it wasn't about money."</p><p>"What did he want?"</p><p>"Without even saying hello, he asked me if I knew you."</p><p>Montalbano thought he hadn't heard right.</p><p>"If you knew who?"</p><p>"You, Salv�, you."</p><p>"And what did you tell him?"</p><p>"Well, I was shitting my pants, so I said, yeah, I knew you, but just casually, by sight-you know, hello, how ya doin'. And he looked at me, you gotta believe me, with a pair of eyes that looked like a statue's eyes, motionless, dead, then he leaned his head back and gave this little laugh and asked me if I wanted to know how many hairs I had on my ass 'cause he could tell me within two. What he meant was that he knew everything about me from the cradle to the grave, and I hope that won't be too soon. And so I just looked at the ground and didn't open my mouth. That's when he told me he wanted to see you."</p><p>"When and where?"</p><p>"Tonight, at dawn. I'll tell you where in a second."</p><p>"Do you know what he wants from me?"</p><p>"I don't know and I don't want to know. He said to rest assured you could trust him like a brother."</p><p>Like a brother. Those words, instead of reassuring Montalbano, sent a shiver down his spine. It was well-known that foremost among Tano's three-or five-murder victims was his older brother Nicolino, whom he first strangled and then, in accordance with some mysterious semiological rule, meticulously flayed. The inspector started thinking dark thoughts, which became even darker, if that was possible, at the words that Geg�, putting his hand on his shoulder, then whispered in his ear.</p><p>"Be careful, Salv�, the guy's an evil beast."</p></p><h2>Knights of Sidonia, Master Edition 2</h2><p><b>One of the manga world's most intriguing artist returns with a science-fiction tour de force which combines post apocolyptic action, modern sci-fi video game tropes and a traditional Japanese aesthetic in The Knights of Sidonia.</b><br><br>Knights of Sidonia has been complied into a Master Edition featuring larger print, colored inserts and omibused volumes.

He then briefly worked as an assistant to veteran comicker Tsutomu Takahashi before making his break-through hit <i>BLAME!</i> (published by Tokyopop). <br><br>The <i>BLAME!</i> franchise was so well received worldwide, that it inspired an animated mini-series and eventually drew the attention of Marvel Comics in the US. Nihei would later go on to draw Wolverine (X-Men) and HALO comics for Marvel to great fanfare.

Hayes, Samuel Tilden, and the Stolen Election of 1876</h2><p>The bitter 1876 contest between Ohio Republican Governor Rutherford B. Hayes and New York Democratic Governor Samuel Tilden was the most sensational and corrupt presidential election in American history. It was also, in many ways, the final battle of the Civil War. Although Tilden received some 265,000 more popular votes than his opponent, and needed only one more electoral vote for victory, contested returns in three southern states still under Republican-controlled Reconstruction governments ultimately led to Hayes's being declared the winner after four tense months of brazen political intrigue and threats of violence that brought armed troops into the streets of the nation's capital. <br> In this major work of popular history and scholarship, Roy Morris, Jr., takes readers to Philadelphia in America's centennial year, where millions celebrated the nation's industrial might and democratic ideals; to the nation's heartland, where Republicans refought the Civil War by waging a cynical "bloody shirt" campaign to tar the Democrats as the party of disunion and rebellion; and finally into the smoke-filled back rooms of Washington, D.C., where the will of the people was thwarted and the newly won rights of four million former slaves were ignored, leading to nearly ninety years of legalized segregation in the South.</p><p>Stop me if you've heard this one: election night comes and goes and the race between two American presidential candidates is too close to call. The popular vote supports the reticent Democrat, but the well-connected Republican is named president after a lengthy and controversial fight over recounts and electoral votes. Of course, we're speaking of the 1876 contest between Rutherford B. Hayes and Samuel Tilden as chronicled in <i>Fraud of the Century</i> by historian Roy Morris Jr. Morris spends much of the book setting the stage by illuminating the characters of both the folksy Hayes from Ohio and the urbane New Yorker Tilden. Though quite different, both men are presented as principled and, ironically enough, committed to wiping out corruption and chicanery. This helps the reader understand the players when the post-election mayhem ensues. The Electoral College is unable to declare a winner after Louisiana, South Carolina, and Florida submit multiple "official" ballots with different victorious candidates. Numerous shady deals are worked out to Hayes's favor while forces loyal to Tilden threaten to march on Washington and install their man by force, if necessary. The most damaging result of the mess, according to Morris, is the pervasive mood of distrust and acrimony on the part of Congress, a mood that would contribute to the South's notorious Jim Crow laws. History buffs will appreciate Morris's extensive research but everyone enjoys a good political thriller. <i>--John Moe</i><b>Roy Morris, Jr.,</b> is the author of <i>The Better Angel: Walt Whitman in the Civil War,</i> as well as biographies of Ambrose Bierce and General Phil Sheridan.

They were capital warships of the &#x201c;ironclad&#x201d; series; the heaviest dreadnoughts constructed in the Midland yards. Balloons the color of flame, shuriken-thrower turrets studding their inflatables, vomiting black exhaust into opiate skies. <br>The flagship leading the trio was a hundred feet long, three red banners embroidered with lotus blooms trailing at her stern. Her name flowed down her bow in broad, bold kanji&#x2014;a warning to any fool who would stand in her way. <br>LADY IZANAMI&#x2019;S HUNGER. <br>If Brother Jubei felt any trepidation about serving on a ship named for the Dark Mother&#x2019;s appetites, he hid it well. He stood at the stern, warm inside the brass shell of his atmos-suit despite the freezing wind. Trying to still the butterflies in his stomach, quiet his pounding heart. Repeating the mantra: &#x201c;skin is strong, flesh is weak, skin is strong, flesh is weak,&#x201d; seeking his center. Yet try as he might, he couldn&#x2019;t still the discontent ringing inside his head. <br>The fleet&#x2019;s captain stood at the railing, surveying the Iishi Mountains below. His atmos-suit was decorated with ornate designs, brass fixtures and pistons embossed with steel-gray filigree. A mechabacus clicked and chittered on his chest; a device of counting beads and vacuum tubes, singing the tuneless song of windup insects. A dozen desiccated tiger tails hung from the spaulders covering the captain&#x2019;s shoulders. They were rumored to have been a gift from the great Fleetmaster of the Tora Chapterhouse, Old Kioshi himself. <br>The captain&#x2019;s name was Montaro, though his crew preferred to call him &#x201c;Scourge of the Gaijin.&#x201d; He was a veteran of the Morcheba invasion, had commanded the Guild fleet supporting Shogunate ground troops against the round-eye barbarians across the Eastborne Sea. But when the war effort had begun disintegrating in the wake of the Shogun&#x2019;s assassination, Chapterhouse Kigen had recalled the captain and set him tracking a new foe, back on Shiman shores. To Brother Jubei&#x2019;s great pride, of all the newly Awakened Shatei in Kigen, Second Bloom Kensai had selected <i>him</i> to serve as the Scourge&#x2019;s new aide. <br>&#x201c;Do you require anything, Captain?&#x201d; Jubei stood at the Scourge&#x2019;s back, a respectful distance away, eyes downcast. <br>&#x201c;A sniff of our quarry would suffice.&#x201d; Faint annoyance in the crackling buzz that passed for the captain&#x2019;s voice. &#x201c;Other than that, this weak flesh abides.&#x201d; He touched a switch, spoke into his wrist. &#x201c;Do you see anything up there, Shatei Masaki?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;No movement, Captain.&#x201d; The lookout&#x2019;s reply was faint, despite him being perched only thirty feet above their heads. &#x201c;But this forest canopy is thick as fog. Even with telescopics, we&#x2019;re hard-pressed to pierce it.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Clever rabbit,&#x201d; the Scourge hissed. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s heard our engines and gone to ground.&#x201d; <br>Jubei watched a spire of rock drift past their starboard; a black iceberg in a sea of maple and cedar. Thin cloud clung to the mountaintops, peaks crusted in snow, the rumble of engines and heavy <i>thupthupthup</i> of propellers echoing in the forest beneath them. Autumn cupped the Iishi Mountains at the edge of a cold embrace, the colors of rust waiting at the edge of the stage. <br>The Scourge sighed, hollow and metallic. <br>&#x201c;I know it to be the impulse of my weak flesh, but I confess I missed these skies.&#x201d; <br>Jubei blinked back his surprise, wondering if he should engage his commanding officer in idle chatter. After long empty moments, the young Guildsman decided it would be impolite not to respond, speaking with hesitance. <br>&#x201c;&#x2026; How long were you stationed in Morcheba, Captain?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Eight years. Eight years with nothing but blood-drinkers and skinthieves for prey.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Is it true the skies above the round-eye lands are blue?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d; The Scourge shook his head. &#x201c;Not anymore. Closer to mauve now.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I would enjoy seeing them one day.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Well, the sooner we butcher our rabbit, the sooner we get back there.&#x201d; Gauntleted fingers drummed the wooden railing. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d hoped to run him down before he reached the Iishi. But he&#x2019;s resourceful, this one.&#x201d; <br>Jubei looked at the ships around them, bristling with weaponry and mercenary marines. The discontent rapped at the inside of his teeth, demanding to be let out for air. <br>&#x201c;Forgive me, Captain,&#x201d; he ventured. &#x201c;I know Old Kioshi&#x2019;s son is a traitor. I know he must be punished for crafting the thunder tiger&#x2019;s wings, aiding in its escape. But this fleet&nbsp;&#x2026; all this effort to kill one boy seems&#x2026;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Excessive?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Hai.&#x201d; A slow nod. &#x201c;I have heard rumor that Old Kioshi and Second Bloom Kensai were as brothers. That Kensai-sama raised the traitor as his own son. But, forgive my temerity&#x2014;does it not seem to you there is more important prey for us to be hunting?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You speak of Yoritomo&#x2019;s assassin.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;And the Kag� rebels who shelter her.&#x201d; <br>The Scourge glanced at him, grim amusement in his voice. <br>&#x201c;Shelter her? She is not exactly hiding from us, young brother. Visiting all four clan capitals in the past fortnight. Bringing the skinless to the edge of outright rebellion. Slaying the Shogun of this nation simply by <i>looking</i> at him.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;All the more reason to hunt her down, surely?&#x201d; Jubei felt righteous anger curdle his voice. &#x201c;The citizenry say we in the Lotus Guild are <i>afraid</i> of her. A slip of a girl. A <i>child</i>. Do you know what they call her, Captain? The skinless, gathered in their filthy gambling pits and smoke houses? Do you know the name they give her?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Stormdancer,&#x201d; the Scourge replied. <br>&#x201c;Worse,&#x201d; Jubei spat. &#x201c;They call her &#x2018;the girl all Guildsmen fear.&#x2019;&#x201d; <br>A hollow chuckle echoed inside the Scourge&#x2019;s helm. &#x201c;Not this Guildsman.&#x201d; <br>Jubei lost his voice, stared at his feet, wondering if he had spoken out of turn. The Scourge glanced at one of their support vessels, the <i>Lotus Wind,</i> rumbling a mile off their stern, twin trails of blue-black exhaust spewing from the ironclad&#x2019;s engines. He touched a switch at his chest, spoke again into his wrist, iron in his voice. <br>&#x201c;Captain Hikita, report.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;&#x2026; o sign,&#x201d; came the faint reply, almost inaudible through the static. &#x201c;&#x2026; ut we are almost directly abov&nbsp;&#x2026; site where the <i>Resplendent Glory</i> picked&nbsp;&#x2026; tsune girl last summer&nbsp;&#x2026; ronghold should be&nbsp;&#x2026; rby.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;He cannot be far,&#x201d; the Scourge growled. &#x201c;He left the river only last night, and on foot. Have your munitioneers prepare a fire barrage. Five-hundred-foot spread from the water&#x2019;s edge. Time to flush this rabbit from his hole.&#x201d; <br>Confirmation crackled down the comms channels, tinged with reverb. <br>The <i>Lotus Wind</i> banked ponderously and trekked back south, the drone of its propellers smudged across the sky. Jubei saw fire crews swarming over the decks like tiny armored ants, loading incendiary barrels, setting ignition charges. He was scanning the forest canopy when the <i>Wind</i>&#x2019;s captain signaled the barrage was finally primed and ready. The Scourge&#x2019;s voice hissed down the all-comms frequency. <br>&#x201c;Lookouts, eyes open. Captain Hikita, commence bombardment.&#x201d; <br>Jubei saw a cluster of black shapes fall from the <i>Wind</i>&#x2019;s belly, tumble down into the autumn shroud below. A second later, all peace shattered, a series of dull whumping booms accompanying the blossoms of flame bursting amidst the trees, unfurling a hundred feet into the air and buffeting the <i>Hunger</i> like a child&#x2019;s toy. Faint vibrations pressed against Jubei&#x2019;s metal skin as the <i>Wind</i> cruised the shuddering riverbank, setting huge swathes of the forest ablaze. <br>The flames caught and spread, licking autumn leaves with fevered tongues, a curtain of choking soot and char drifting through the woods on blackened feet. Off the starboard side, their second escort, <i>Void&#x2019;s Truth</i> dumped a second cluster of firebombs amidst the ancient trees, trembling reverb echoing down the river valley. Flocks of shrieking birds took to the wing, animals of all shapes and sizes fleeing north through the undergrowth, away from the grasping flames. Jubei watched it all unfold with a kind of fascination&#x2014;the power of his Guild&#x2019;s technology obliterating what had taken centuries to grow in a matter of moments. <br>&#x201c;Any sign?&#x201d; the Scourge asked over all-comms. <br>&#x201c;Negative,&#x201d; reported the <i>Wind</i>&#x2019;s lookouts. <br>&#x201c;No sign,&#x201d; from the <i>Hunger</i>&#x2019;s eyes above. <br>The <i>Truth</i>&#x2019;s reply popped with faint static. &#x201c;We have contact. Three hundred yards, north-northeast. Acknowledge?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I have him,&#x201d; reported the <i>Hunger</i>&#x2019;s lookout. &#x201c;Seventy degrees starboard.&#x201d; <br>The <i>Hunger</i>&#x2019;s pilot kicked the engines to full burn, the propellers&#x2019; song rising an octave as they swung about to begin pursuit. Jubei engaged his telescopics, scanning the shifting chinks in the forest canopy as a sudden sweat burned his eyes. The vista below crackling sharp in his vision. Smoke coiled amidst moss-encrusted giants. Falling leaves and fleeing birds. An empire of bark and stone. But at last, yes, he saw him, he <i>saw</i> him&#x2014;a thin figure in dirty gray, darting between two gnarled and looming maples. <br>&#x201c;There!&#x201d; Jubei cried. &#x201c;There he is!&#x201d; <br>Short dark hair. Pale skin. Gone. <br>&#x201c;Ground crews, prepare for pursuit.&#x201d; The Scourge&#x2019;s command was calm as millpond water. &#x201c;&#x2019;Thrower teams full alert. Second Bloom has ordered us to liquidate target on sight.&#x201d; <br>The <i>Truth</i>&#x2019;s shuriken-throwers opened up, followed by the <i>Hunger</i>&#x2019;s; twin batteries of razor-sharp stars spraying from their flanks and shredding the curtain of curling leaves below. Severed branches crashed earthward, the <i>chug!chug!chug!chug!</i> of the &#x2019;throwers ringing over the rush of starving flames. Jubei thought he saw their quarry flitting amidst the undergrowth, a hail of gleaming death raining all around him. The <i>Hunger</i>&#x2019;s marines were performing final weapons checks, readying to drop into the woods below. Flames to the south. Troops and spinning death from above. Ironclads overhead. <br>Jubei smiled to himself, surging flames reflected on metal skin. The rabbit had led them on a long chase, to be sure. But at last, his luck had come to an end. <br>The Scourge turned from the railing, grim satisfaction in his voice. &#x201c;You may get to see Morcheba sooner than you&#x2014;&#x201d; <br>A flash of light. <br>Searing. Magnesium-white. It took a split second for the shock wave to catch up to the flare. Jubei saw the air around him grow brighter, highlights glinting on brass skin. And then came thunder&#x2014;a shuddering, bone-shaking report sending <i>Lady Izanami&#x2019;s Hunger</i> skidding sideways across the sky, engines wailing in soot-smeared protest. Jubei lost his balance, and to his shame, clutched the Scourge&#x2019;s arm to stop himself falling. <br>A rush of superheated air. Tortured metal screaming, the hollow thudding booms of secondary explosions. Jubei turned, breath catching in his lungs, unable to comprehend what he was seeing. <br>The ironclad off their starboard. <i>Void&#x2019;s Truth</i>. A complement of twenty Guild marines, twelve Lotusmen, four Artificers, six officers and thirty crew. All of them. <br>They were falling from the sky. <br>The inflatable was simply gone, a long, ragged fireball swelling within a blackened exoskeleton, great flaming hands reaching down to incinerate anything on her deck. Cables snapping, motors whining as she reared up under unrestrained thrust, bow pointing into the sky even as they plummeted earthward. The comms system was filled with screaming; tiny burning figures spilling over the railings and tumbling toward maws of rock hundreds of feet below. Jubei could see a few crewmen struggling with the aft lifeboat, bent low in terror. Another deafening explosion sounded as the <i>Truth</i>&#x2019;s chi reserves ignited, her backside blew apart in a shower of blazing shrapnel, and she spun end over end toward her grave. <br>&#x201c;What in the First Bloom&#x2019;s name?&#x201d; the Scourge bellowed into the comms system. &#x201c;What hit us? Report!&#x201d; <br>The <i>Hunger</i>&#x2019;s crew was in chaos. Marines scrambling for the secondary shuriken-throwers. Shouted orders. Running feet. Fire teams on the dirigible yelling for target coordinates, lookouts aiming their telescopics through the billowing smoke, ashes falling like rain. Jubei saw the blue-white flare of rocket-trails through the haze off the starboard side; brothers who had survived the explosion and managed to engage their jet packs. <br>&#x201c;There!&#x201d; he yelled. &#x201c;Survivors!&#x201d; <br>The closest Shatei was forty feet from the <i>Hunger</i>&#x2019;s railing when it took him. A flash of white amidst the smoke, the squealing crunch of ruptured metal, a strangled shout. And then Jubei saw the rocket pack flare and die, a haze of red, and the brother tumbled from the sky, the top half of his body struggling to keep pace with his legs. <br>&#x201c;First Bloom, save us,&#x201d; he whispered. <br>Jubei felt the <i>Hunger</i> shudder, heard a bass-thick crackling across blood-red skies. A sound that shivered the flesh inside his skin, rivets squealing, deck trembling under his feet like a child beneath his sheets in the thick, dead of night. The unmistakable roar of thunder. And yet, aside from the smoke, the skies around them were clear as polished glass&nbsp;&#x2026; <br>&#x201c;Battle stations!&#x201d; the Scourge roared. &#x201c;Battle stations!&#x201d; <br>Jubei heard the shuriken-throwers arcing up again; a heavy <i>chug!chug!chug!chug!,</i> the hiss of pressurized gas, the clunking clatter of feeder belts. The sky around them sparkled with shards of razored steel, withering death sprayed blindly into the smoke. The mechabacus upon his chest spat a chattering spiel, confirmation requests from Chapterhouse Kigen flooding his inputs. His hands were shaking too hard to respond. <br>Screams again. Cries of &#x201c;Contact! Contact!&#x201d; A pinprick of flame off the stern. Jubei looked behind in time to see that same white silhouette skirting the <i>Lotus Wind</i>&#x2019;s inflatable, talons rending the reinforced canvas of their sister ship like damp rice-paper. <br>The world held still for a fleeting second, the deathly hush between one heartbeat and the next. Jubei looked across the space between him and that white blur, a sky of spinning steel and acrid smoke, and in that tiny, fragile moment, he saw her: a black shape, long hair whipping in an ember wind, crouched between two metal wings on the back of an absolute impossibility. And as its long and terrible talons ripped the <i>Wind</i>&#x2019;s inflatable asunder, he saw a flash of orange light in the girl&#x2019;s hand, a tiny flame at the end of a handheld flare, tumbling from her fingertips toward the escaping hydrogen. <br>And then light. Rippling, deafening light. <br>The explosion rocked the <i>Hunger</i> on to her starboard, the shock wave sending four marines over the side and into the abyss. Fire blossomed, the <i>Wind</i>&#x2019;s inflatable tearing apart like an overfull bladder, timbers snapping, choking smoke. The Scourge bellowing, the chatter of shuriken fire, the roar of wounded engines, the ironclad spinning like a child&#x2019;s toy as the white shape swooped around and down the port side amidst a hail of &#x2019;thrower fire, taking the <i>Wind</i>&#x2019;s engine off at her shoulder. <br> <i>So fast. So impossibly fast.</i> <br>&#x201c;Concentrate fire! All &#x2019;throwers fire! FIRE!&#x201d; <br>The shape wheeled away, keeping the <i>Wind</i>&#x2019;s tumbling corpse between itself and the <i>Hunger</i> until it was well out of range, diving behind a towering knuckle of black mountain stone. Jubei heard a rumbling crash as the <i>Wind</i> hit bottom, flaring like a second sun as her chi tanks exploded, setting the autumn valley ablaze. The pilot was spinning the wheel beside him, the <i>Hunger</i>&#x2019;s nose swinging towar...</p><h2>Outer Banks Cookbook: Recipes &amp; Traditions From North Carolina's Barrier Islands</h2><p><p>More than seven million people visit the Outer Banks of North Carolina every year, and they all fall in love with its coastal Southern cuisine. <i>The Outer Banks Cookbook</i> is a true celebration of the many flavors of North Carolina&#x2019;s coastal communities with an emphasis on local food and products.

His advice has healed shattered families and changed lives. Now in his first book on the lessons he has learned, he asks parents to reject the ,common sense' that tells them to ,lay down the law', ground teens, or try to coerce them into changing behaviour. These strategies have never worked, asserts Dr Glasser, and never will. Instead he offers a different approach based upon Choice Theory. Glasser spells out the seven deadly habits parents practiSe and then shows them how to accomplish their goals by changing their own behaviour. Above all, he helps parents keep their relationship with their child strong. Dr Glasser provides a groundbreaking method that any parent can use with confidence and love.</p></p><p><p>William Glasser, M.D., is a world-renowned psychiatrist who lectures widely.

This book analyzes what religion says about God&#39;s heart and personality and measures it up to what God calls Himself: Love. It simplifies a generation&#39;s tangled perceptions of God by taking a journey through the sixteen aspects of love described in one of the most well-known Bible passages in the world: 1 Corinthians 13, also known as &#34;the love chapter.&#34; So many Christians have been bombarded with confusing teachings and doctrines that their understanding of God resembles a tightly tangled ball of Christmas tree lights. This book takes that twisted mess and replaces it with one soft, warm light of truth that anyone can embrace: God is love.</p><p>Darin Hufford is the host of the <i>Into the Wild</i> podcast and the founder and president of the Free Believers Network. He travels and speaks throughout the world on knowing the heart of God. Currently, Darin lives in Phoenix, Arizona, with his wife, Angie, and their five children."A good book is a good read. A great book forces you to actually put it down, go away, and digest what you just read because of how it messed with your heart or head. This is a great book!"&#x2015;<b>Drew Marshall, host of The Drew Marshall Show, Canada's most-listened-to spiritual talk show</b><br><br>"Be ready to have your spiritual world rocked. Hufford takes us outside the traditional misunderstandings of God and shows us the Father Jesus constantly spoke about."&#x2015;<b>Wayne Jacobsen, collaborator on The Shack</b></p><h2>Closing the Window: Steps to Living Porn Free</h2><p>Pornography is everywhere. Far too many Christians regularly use and are addicted to it, warping their perception of sexuality and relationships, destroying marriages and ministries. But Christians who struggle with porn also long for change. When we realize the unfulfilling emptiness of porn, we come to yearn for freedom from it. But what do we do? Tim Chester says that we can be captured by a better vision--a liberating confidence that God offers more than pornography does. Moving beyond pat answers or mere willpower, Chester offers spiritual, practical and corporate resources for living porn free. He exposes the false promises of porn and redirects us to the true promises of God. With assurance of God&#39;s grace and cleansing power, we can change our desires and escape the traps and temptations of pornography. However great the challenge, God&#39;s grace is even greater. And we can come to a place where we no longer feel the need to use porn. Close the window on porn. And open the door to freedom, integrity and new life.</p><p><strong>Tim Chester</strong> (Ph.D., University of Wales) is a church planter and Bible teacher. He serves as codirector of The Porterbrook Network, which equips individuals and churches to rediscover mission, and director of the Northern Training Institute, which provides integrated theological and missional training for church leaders. He is coleader of the Crowded House, a group of church-planting networks. His books include <em>Good News to the Poor, The Message of Prayer, Total Church</em> and <em>You Can Change.</em> He and his family live in Sheffield, U.K."It is great that a Christian leader has taken the risk to write a book on a topic that at this point remains controversial. What is the church to do? Which programs are churches to promote and support? What obligation do pastors and leaders have to help those struggling with pornography and other addictions? If it is true that a third of people in churches are struggling with porn, according to Chester, then this book and 20 more should be written until our churches hear the alarm and address this issue." (Kent Miller, YouthWorker Journal, March-April 2011)<br><br>"Tim Chester's <em>Closing the Window</em> provides insightful reflection on the problems that many Christians who are struggling with pornography will find easy to relate to. Full of practical and spiritual insights, it stays true to the message of grace and hope that is found in the gospel of Christ." (William M. Struthers, associate professor of psychology, Wheaton College, and author of Wired for Intimacy: How Pornography Hijacks the Male Brain)<br><br>"Finally, a book which rightly puts the struggle with purity, pornography and sexuality into the larger biblical framework of what it means to know God in the midst of our brokenness! This is a wonderful resource to add to the arsenal of anyone serious about finding freedom from the power of pornography. In addition to that, Tim has written a book that can be effectively used by pastors and leaders. It is an excellent pastoral tool to help those dealing with and impacted by the false promises and lies of our porn-is-the-norm culture." (John Freeman, president, Harvest USA (www.harvestusa.org))<br><br>"One of the greatest challenges facing Christians today is the call to sexual purity and integrity. Tim Chester's book will prove indispensable for those committed to that challenge. By exposing the lies that fuel pornography addiction and offering practical tips for staying free, he arms us with the tools we need to win the battle against porn." (Andy Comiskey, founder and director, Desert Stream Ministries, and author of Strength in Weakness and Naked Surrender)<br><br>"Tim Chester offers hope, and the possibility of living free from the snare of pornography. . . . Without sounding superspiritual or piling on the guilt, this book emphasizes the fact that we cannot change without God's help. . . . Chester's diligent research and nonjudgmental approach will, I promise, help many Christians who are struggling with porn." (Lyndon Bowring, executive chairman, CARE)<br><br>"Christians think sex is great, but its misuse is bad! Pornography draws Christian men into a dark world where shame and guilt replace joy and freedom. This book superbly diagnoses the problem and points to God's healing. Tim Chester's writing will rescue many a marriage and restore many a man to a place where purity and passion coexist in biblical relationship." (Stephen and Janet Gaukroger, Clarion Trust International)<br><br>"Tim Chester believes that churches need to talk about porn, and has written a helpful book that explains why. I believe it will be a lifeline for those who feel trapped and say, 'I can't change.' It contains a message of grace, strength and hope." (Ian Coffey, director of leadership training, Moorlands College)<br><br>"Tim Chester has hit the nail on the head! Pornography is a cancer eating the heart of the church, and this excellent book tackles it head-on. As you would expect, it is thoroughly rooted in the Bible, very well researched and highly accessible. Crucially, Tim also offers fantastic practical and realistic help and advice that us men would do well to take advantage of. I highly commend this timely book."

Finally, thinking is slow, and that's a problem when our habits of consuming information (mostly online) leave us lost in the echo chamber of social media, where speed and factionalism trump accuracy and nuance.In this clever, witty book, Jacobs diagnoses the many forces that prevent thought - forces that have only worsened in the age of Twitter, such as "alternative facts," and information overload. He also dispels the many myths we hold about what it means to think well. (For example: it's impossible to "think for yourself.")Drawing on sources as far-flung as the novelist Marilynne Robinson, the basketball legend Wilt Chamberlain, the British philosopher John Stuart Mill and the Christian theologian C.S. Lewis, Jacobs digs into the nuts and bolts of the cognitive process, offering hope that each of us can reclaim our mental lives from the whirlpool of what now passes for public debate.After all, if we can learn to think together, perhaps we can learn to live together.<br></p><p></p><h2>Lulu and the Duck in the Park (1)</h2><p>When Lulu finds a duck egg that has rolled out of its nest, she takes it to class to keep it safe.

I&#x2019;ve been racking my brains to think of a way of addressing your theme of magic carpets and international perspectives, because I think one should at least try, and I&#x2019;ve come to the conclusion that although I&#x2019;m not going to say anything directly about that, what I do have to say is as true as I can make it. I&#x2019;m going to talk about responsibility.<br><br> And responsibility is a subject I&#x2019;ve been thinking about a lot recently, because it has a bearing on the way the world is going, and on whether or not our profession, our art or craft, has anything to contribute to the continual struggle to make the world a better place; or whether what we do is, in the last analysis, trivial and irrelevant. Of course, there are several views about the relationship between art and the world, with at one end of the spectrum the Soviet idea that the writer is the engineer of human souls, that art has a social function and had better damn well produce what the state needs, and at the other end the declaration of Oscar Wilde that there is no such thing as a good book or a bad book; books are well written or badly written, that is all; and all art is quite useless. However, it&#x2019;s notable that the book in which he wrote those words as a preface, <i>The Picture of Dorian Gray</i>, is one of the most moral stories that was ever written, so even Saint Oscar admitted with part of himself that art does have a social and ethical function.&nbsp;<br><br> Anyway, I take it that art, literature, children&#x2019;s literature, do not exist in an ivory tower; I take it that we&#x2019;re inextricably part of the world, the whole world; and that we have several kinds of responsibility that follow from that.&nbsp;<br><br> So that&#x2019;s what I&#x2019;m going to talk about briefly this evening&#x2014;the responsibility of the storyteller&#x2014;and how far it extends, and what directions it extends in, and where it stops.&nbsp;<br><br> The first responsibility to talk about is a social and financial one: the sort of responsibility we share with many other citizens&#x2014;the need to look after our families and those who depend on us. People of my age will probably remember that wonderfully terrifying advertisement they used to have for Pearl Assurance. It told a little story which I used to read all the way through every time I saw it. When many years later I learned the meaning of the word catharsis, I realised what it was that I&#x2019;d been feeling as I read that little story: I had been purged by pity and terror.&nbsp;<br><br> The advertisement consisted of five drawings of a man&#x2019;s face. The first was labelled &#x201c;At age 25,&#x201d; and it showed a bright-eyed, healthy, optimistic young fellow, full of pep and vigour, with a speech balloon saying &#x201c;They tell me the job doesn&#x2019;t carry a pension.&#x201d;<br><br> Each succeeding drawing showed him ten years older, and the speech balloons changed with each one. At forty-five, for example, he was looking sombre and lined and heavy with responsibility, and saying &#x201c;Unfortunately, the job is not pensionable.&#x201d; It ended with him at sixty-five: wrinkled, haggard, wild-eyed, a broken-down old man staring into the very abyss of poverty and decrepitude, and saying, &#x201c;Without a pension <i>I really don&#x2019;t know what I shall do!</i>&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br> Well, I&#x2019;m not going to sell you a pension. I&#x2019;m just going to say that we should all insist that we&#x2019;re properly paid for what we do. We should sell our work for as much as we can decently get for it, and we shouldn&#x2019;t be embarrassed about it. Some tender and sentimental people&#x2014;especially young people&#x2014;are rather shocked when I tell them that I write books to make money, and I want to make a lot, if I can.&nbsp;<br><br> When we start writing books we&#x2019;re all poor; we all have to do another job in the daytime and write at night; and, frankly, it&#x2019;s not as romantic as it seems to those who aren&#x2019;t doing it. Worry&#x2014;constant low-level unremitting anxiety about bank statements and mortgages and bills&#x2014;is not a good state of mind to write in. I&#x2019;ve done it. It drains your energy; it distracts you; it weakens your concentration. The only good thing about being poor and obscure is the obscurity&#x2014;just as the only trouble with being rich and famous is the fame.&nbsp;<br><br> But if we find we can make money by writing books, by telling stories, we have the <i>responsibility</i>&#x2014;the responsibility to our families, and those we look after&#x2014;of doing it as well and as profitably as we can. Here&#x2019;s a useful piece of advice to young writers: cultivate a <i>reputation</i>&#x2014;which need have no basis in reality&#x2014;but cultivate a reputation of being very fond of money. If the people you have to deal with think that you like the folding stuff a great deal, they&#x2019;ll think twice before they offer you very small amounts of it. What&#x2019;s more, by expecting to get paid properly for the work we do, we&#x2019;re helping our fellow writers in their subsequent dealings with schools, or festivals, or prisons, or whatever. I feel not a flicker of shame about declaring that I want as much money for my work as I can get. But, of course, what that money is buying, what it&#x2019;s for, is security, and space, and peace and quiet, and time.&nbsp;<br><br> The next responsibility I want to talk about is the writer&#x2019;s, the storyteller&#x2019;s, responsibility towards language. Once we become conscious of the way language works, and our relationship to it, we can&#x2019;t pretend to be innocent about it; it&#x2019;s not just something that happens to us, and over which we have no influence. If human beings can affect the climate, we can certainly affect the language, and those of us who use it professionally are responsible for looking after it. This is the sort of taking-care-of-the-tools that any good worker tries to instil in an apprentice&#x2014;keeping the blades sharp, oiling the bearings, cleaning the filters.&nbsp;<br><br> I don&#x2019;t have to tell any of you the importance of having a good dictionary, or preferably several. Every writer I know is fascinated by words, and developed the habit of looking things up at a very early age. Words change, they have a history as well as a contemporary meaning; it&#x2019;s worth knowing those things. We should acquire as many reference books as we have space for&#x2014;old and out-of-date ones as well as new ones&#x2014;and make a habit of using them, and take pride in getting things right. The internet also knows a thing or two, but I still prefer books. There&#x2019;s a pleasure in discharging this responsibility&#x2014;of sensing that we&#x2019;re not sure of a particular point of grammar, for example, and in looking it up, and getting it to work properly.&nbsp;<br><br> Sometimes we come across people in our professional lives who think that this sort of thing doesn&#x2019;t matter very much, and it&#x2019;s silly to make a fuss about it. If only a few people recognise and object to a dangling participle, for example, and most readers don&#x2019;t notice and sort of get the sense anyway, why bother to get it right? Well, I discovered a very good answer to that, and it goes like this: if most people don&#x2019;t notice when we get it wrong, <i>they won&#x2019;t mind if we get it right</i>. And if we <i>do </i>get it right, we&#x2019;ll please the few who do know and care about these things, so everyone will be happy.&nbsp;<br><br> A simple example: the thing that annoys me most at the moment is the silly confusion between <i>may </i>and <i>might</i>. &#x201c;Without the code-breaking work at Bletchley Park, Britain may well have lost the Second World War,&#x201d; you hear people say, as if they&#x2019;re not sure whether we did or not. What they mean is, &#x201c;Britain <i>might </i>well have lost the Second World War.&#x201d; They should bloody well learn how to say it. Anyway, when I see someone getting that sort of thing right, I become just a little more sure that I can rely on the language they&#x2019;re using.&nbsp;<br><br> Of course, we can make our <i>characters </i>talk any way we like. It used to be one of the ways in which snobbish writers would mark the difference between characters who were to be admired and those who were to be condescended to. I think we&#x2019;ve grown a little beyond that now; but when a present-day writer hears the difference between &#x201c;bored with&#x201d; and &#x201c;bored of,&#x201d; and uses it with brilliant accuracy to mark not so much a class difference as a generational one, as Neil Gaiman does in his marvellous book <i>Coraline</i>, then he&#x2019;s being responsible to the language in just the way I&#x2019;m talking about.&nbsp;<br><br> As well as taking care of the words, we should take care of the expressions, the idioms. We should become attuned to our own utterances; we should install a little mental bell that rings when we&#x2019;re using expressions that are second-hand or blurred through too much use. We should try always to use language to illuminate, reveal and clarify rather than obscure, mislead and conceal. The language should be safe in our hands&#x2014;safer than it is in those of politicians, for example; at the least, people should be able to say that we haven&#x2019;t left it any poorer, or clumsier, or less precise.&nbsp;<br><br> The aim must always be clarity. It&#x2019;s tempting to feel that if a passage of writing is obscure, it must be very deep. But if the water is murky, the bottom might be only an inch below the surface&#x2014;you just can&#x2019;t tell. It&#x2019;s much better to write in such a way that the readers can see all the way down; but that&#x2019;s not the end of it, because you then have to provide interesting things down there for them to look at. Telling a story involves thinking of some interesting events, putting them in the best order to bring out the connections between them, and telling about them as clearly as we can; and if we get the last part right, we won&#x2019;t be able to disguise any failure with the first&#x2014;which is actually the most difficult, and the most important.&nbsp;<br><br> When it comes to imaginative language, to rich and inventive imagery, we have to beware. But what we have to beware of is too much caution. We must never say to ourselves: &#x201c;That&#x2019;s a good image&#x2014;very clever; too clever for this book, though&#x2014;save it up for something important.&#x201d; Someone who never did that, someone who put the best of his imagination into everything he wrote, was the great Leon Garfield. Here&#x2019;s a passage from one of my favourites among his books, <i>The Pleasure Garden (1976)</i>:&nbsp;<br><br>"Mrs. Bray was the proprietress of the Mulberry Garden . . . Although a widow for seven years, she still wore black, which lent her bulk a certain mystery; sometimes it was hard to see where she ended and the night began. Dr. Dormann, standing beside her, looked thinner than ever, really no more than a mere slice of a man who might have come off Mrs. Bray in a carelessly slammed door."<br><br> There&#x2019;s fast-food language, and there&#x2019;s caviar language; one of the things we adults need to do for children is to introduce them to the pleasures of the subtle and the complex. One way to do that, of course, is to let them see us enjoying it, and then forbid them to touch it, on the grounds that it&#x2019;s too grown-up for them, their minds aren&#x2019;t ready to cope with it, it&#x2019;s too strong, it&#x2019;ll drive them mad with strange and uncontrollable desires. If that doesn&#x2019;t make them want to try it, nothing will.&nbsp;<br><br> Next in my list of responsibilities comes honesty&#x2014;emotional honesty. We should never try to draw on emotional credit to which our story is not entitled. A few years ago, I read a novel&#x2014;a pretty undistinguished family story&#x2014;which, in an attempt to wring tears from the reader, quite gratuitously introduced a Holocaust theme. The theme had nothing to do with the story&#x2014;it was there for one purpose only, which was to force a particular response and then graft it onto the book. An emotional response from the reader is a precious thing&#x2014;it&#x2019;s the reader&#x2019;s gift to us, in a way; they should be able to trust the stimulus that provokes it. It&#x2019;s perfectly possible&#x2014;difficult, but possible&#x2014;to write an honest story about the Holocaust, or about slavery, or about any of the other terrible things that human beings have done to one another, but that was a dishonest one. Stories should earn their own tears and not pilfer them from elsewhere.&nbsp;<br><br> When it comes to the sheer craft of depicting things, describing them, saying what happened, the film director and playwright David Mamet said something very interesting. He said that the basic storytelling question is: &#x201c;Where do I put the camera?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br> Thinking about that fascinating, that fathomlessly interesting, question is part of our responsibility towards the craft. Taking cinematography as a metaphor for storytelling, and realising that around every subject there are 360 degrees of space, and an infinity of positions from very close to very far, from very low to very high, at which you can put that camera&#x2014;then it seems that the <i>great</i> director, the great storyteller, knows immediately and without thinking what the best position is, and goes there unhesitatingly. They seem to see it as clearly as we can see that leaves are green.&nbsp;<br><br> A good director will choose one of the half-dozen best positions. A bad director won&#x2019;t know, and will move the camera about, fidgeting with the angles, trying all sorts of tricky shots or fancy ways of telling the story, and forgetting that the function of the camera is not to draw attention to itself, but to show something else&#x2014;the subject&#x2014;with as much clarity as it can manage.&nbsp;<br><br> But actually, the truth is that great directors only <i>seem </i>as if they know the best place at once. The notebooks of great writers and composers are full of hesitations and mistakes and crossings-out; perhaps the real difference is that they<i> keep on</i> till they&#x2019;ve found the best place to put the camera. The responsibility of those of us who are neither very good nor very bad is to imitate the best, to look closely at what they do and try to emulate it, to take the greatest as our models.</p><h2>Master Thieves: The Boston Gangsters Who Pulled Off the World&#39;s Greatest Art Heist</h2><p><b>As featured on the "Last Seen" podcast, the thrilling, definitive story of the $500m Gardner Museum art heist, full of "characters that would make Martin Scorsese swoon" (<i>Boston Globe</i>)</b><br><br>In a secret meeting in 1981, a low-level Boston thief gave career gangster Ralph Rossetti the tip of a lifetime: the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum was a big score waiting to happen.

Written from her dual perspective as a psychologist and a mother, Lerner brings us deeply personal tales that run the gamut from the hilarious to the heart-wrenching. From birth or adoption to the empty nest, <em>The Mother Dance</em> teaches the basic lessons of motherhood: that we are not in control of what happens to our children, that most of what we worry about doesn't happen, and that our children will love us with all our imperfections if we can do the same for them. Here is a gloriously witty and moving book about what it means to dance the mother dance.</p></p><p>How does motherhood change you? Who or what do you become when you become a mother? "We can't begin to know what our children will evoke in us until we have them," says psychologist and psychotherapist Dr. Harriet Lerner, author of the bestselling <i>The Dance of Anger</i>. Lerner set out to write a book on parenting, and ended up with a thoughtful and honest book focusing on the experience of being a mother--a woman's experiences, needs, and changes as she travels through the trials and pleasures of pregnancy, birth, power struggles, guilt, anxiety, relationship challenges, sibling struggles, and separation. Filled with personal stories and case studies, <i>The Mother Dance</i> offers mothers-to-be a guide for the road ahead, and women who are already mothers will recognize their own dilemmas and situations, and gain clarity about their experiences. Throughout, Lerner is wise, personal, and truthful about her own failings. This book is a welcome addition to the recent discourse on the mothering experience. <i>--Ericka Lutz</i>Being a mother comes as naturally to me as being an astronaut. Nor do I occupy any moral high ground when I help other mothers to achieve clarity, objectivity, and calm.When I started this book, I had one son in high school and another in college. I completed the project two years later from the vantage point of a newly empty nest. I�ve valued the opportunity to look back at my own complex experience of mothering, and I&#39;ve not hesitated to share the best and worst of it. Your kids will make you love them in a way you never thought possible. They will also confront you will all the painful and unsavory emotions that we try so hard to avoid. Children will teach you about yourself, and about what it&#39;s like not to be up to the demands of the most important responsibility you&#39;ll ever have. When you become a mother, you learn that you are capable of deep compassion, and also that you&#39;re definitely not the nice, highly evolved person you fancied yourself to be before you became a mother. The novelist Fay Weldon puts it best. The greatest advantage of not having children must be that you can go on believing you are a good person. Once you have children, you realize how wars start. Welcome to the mother dance!</p><h2>Where Is Home, Little Pip?</h2><p>For Little Pip, the baby penguin, home is a pebbly nest on the cold Antartic shore. Mama and Papa always reminds Pip not to wander far, and she never does...until one day a black, glittery feather leads Pip on a chase far, far from home. As she tries to find her way back to her parents, Pip encounters some friendly animals, a mighty blue whale, a gull, and even a sled dog. But while these animals know where their home is, they do not know where Pip&#39;s home is. In her sadness, Pip begins to sing a song about home that her parents taught her, and the sound of her voice guides her parents straight to her!</p><p>Karma Wilson is the bestselling author of several picture books, including the Bear Books series,&nbsp;<i>Where Is Home, Little Pip?</i>, and&nbsp;<i>A Dog Named Doug</i>.&nbsp;Karma lives in Montana.<br><br>Jane Chapman is the illustrator of over one hundred books for children, including&nbsp;<i>Dilly Duckling</i>&nbsp;by Claire Freedman and&nbsp;<i>I Love My Mama&nbsp;</i>by Peter Kavanagh, as well as Karma Wilson&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>Bear Snores On</i>,&nbsp;<i>Bear Wants More</i>,&nbsp;<i>Bear Stays Up for Christmas</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Mortimer&#x2019;s Christmas Manger</i>.

A young penguin loves to play and explore but is constantly warned by her doting parents not to wander far. Every night they sing a song reminding her that "our home is...in our pebbly nest by the stormy sea,/where Mama and Papa and Pip makes three." (The grammatical error is unfortunate.) One day, inevitably, Pip wanders off and becomes lost. She asks the different animals that she encounters, "Where is home?" But for each creature, home is a different place. Alone and frightened in the frozen wilderness, Pip sings the song that Mama and Papa taught her, and, like a talisman, it brings them together for a joyful reunion ("Since we're together, home is right here!"). Well-structured text, genuine emotions, and beautiful full-bleed illustrations in a palette that ranges from cool whites and blues to warm pinks, corals, and tans combine to produce a wonderful story of a loving family separated and then reunited. Pair this tale with reassuring stories such as Harry Horse's <i>Little Rabbit Lost</i> (Peachtree, 2002), Janell Cannon's <i>Stellaluna</i> (Harcourt, 1993), and Martin Waddell's <i>Owl Babies</i> (Candlewick, 1992).&#x2014;<i>Jane Marino, Bronxville Public Library, NY</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

She eventually lost over 80 pounds using this method of eating, but she had mixed results at first. She finally realized her big mistake: she was making it too complicated. She did not need to count calories, restrict carbs, or even limit her portion sizes. She found the best results when she made her plan simple and easy. When she started to practice intermittent fasting six days a week, walk six miles a day, and take a cheat day on Sunday, she found she could lose weight easily and consistently. She&#39;s kept off the weight with what feels like very little effort, and has found she loves intermittent fasting as a way of life. She&#39;s even started a YouTube channel which now has over 27,000 subscribers, in order to tell others about the benefits she&#39;s had with intermittent fasting. She wrote this book to give an in depth look at the weight loss journey she went on, including the struggles she had, the mistakes she made, and the process she used to lose the weight. The Laid Back Guide To Intermittent Fasting will give you all the tips, tricks, and lessons she&#39;s learned on her journey to easy and permanent weight loss.</p><p></p><h2>Patient.</h2><p>Poetry. African American Studies. Women's Studies. "Bettina Judd's phenomenal debut poetry collection, PATIENT., is about recovery in many senses: recovery of the subjectivity of several historical figures, through the recovery, reconstitution, and telling of their stories--among them Anarcha Westcott, Betsey Harris, Lucy Zimmerman, Joice Heth, Saartjie Baartman, and Henrietta Lacks, who were infamously 'patients' or subjects of inspection and 'plunder' by, among others, J. Marion Sims, the controversial gynecologist, and P.T. Barnum, showman and circus founder. Sims (and the speculum) and Barnum are the featured antagonists in many of these flawlessly empathetic poems, but an unnamed speaker who adds a contemporary voice to the lyric chorus implicates those in charge of her care during a present-day hospital stay at Johns Hopkins--suggesting the linkage of modern medical treatment to the traumas vulnerable Black women, enslaved and not, suffered at the hands of unethical scientists and physicians in earlier eras.<br> <br> In the collection's opening poem, the speaker reckons, '...verdicts come in a bloodline' and she determines 'to recover' from 'an ordeal with medicine' by 'learn[ing] why ghosts come to me.' She ends her testimony by asking, 'Why am I patient?' (Read that line in however many nuanced ways you want.) In this profoundly layered witnessing, the subject might be 'in the dark ghetto of my body,' or 'an idea of metaphors that live where bodies cannot.' Yet even as Judd vividly evokes the precise brutalities visited upon the Black female body and psyche--letting us see and hear women who 'quieted / broke into many pieces'--these poems also speak of 'shedding something,' 'another kind of sloughing.' Ultimately, PATIENT. enacts a healing and move toward wholeness, recovery of, as one speaker puts it, 'spirit [that] flees the body and / its treacherous / tearing.'"--Sharan Strange</p><p>In Patient. Bettina Judd beautifully (and horrifically) draws on historical evidence of nineteenth-century medical experimentation on black women, scholarly explorations of the body and the archive, and personal medical history. &nbsp;The result is haunting in its insistence on laying bare these stories as they not only articulate experiences of the past but also resonate deeply with black women's experiences with the U.S. medical complex in the present. &nbsp;Patient. is a brilliant meditation on race, gender, and science and a thrilling anthem to black women's self-knowledge. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;--Elsa Barkley Brown, Associate Professor of History and Women's Studies, University of Maryland, College Park<br><br>J. Marion Sims, the legendary, now controversial, 19th century gynecologist looms large in Bettina Judd's recent collection Patient. Sophisticated, complex, haunting, Patient. beckons readers to remember, to feel, to think deeply, to discover, to probe. &nbsp;Slavery's stench, the bodies of Black women, death, scientific racism, memory--these themes link the poems in extraordinary ways. &nbsp;Judd is a masterful new poet. Patient. is unforgettable!!--Beverly Guy-Sheftall, Founding Director and Anna Julia Cooper Professor of Women's Studies, Spelman College<br><br>Joice Heth. Lucy Zimmerman. Betsey Harris. Anarcha Wescott. Bettina Judd ensures you will remember the names of four women assaulted by science, violated by curiosity--survivors of physical invasion and torturous experiments. She presents their dignity, heretofore denied, as imagined in their own voices in conversation and parallel with a modern speaker, similarly (coldly) ensnared by a medical machine powered by detachment at best, cruelty at worst. Judd re-centers the narrative, however, to where it belongs--on the person(s) confronted, examined, in pain--not on the problem to be studied or solved. In visceral language that indicts, worships, haunts, and empowers, Patient. illuminates "a dynasty, a bloodline, a body" imbued with the full human spectrum of emotion and brilliance.--Khadijah Queen, author of Conduit and Black Peculiar<br><br>Bettina Judd's stunning poetry invites us to imagine the experiences of enslaved women subjected to gynecological experiments--the blood, pain, loss, shame, and survival. &nbsp;Linking past and present, Patient. brilliantly condemns the inhumanity of professionals who infringe black women's bodies and celebrates the humanity of those who resist them. &nbsp;It will disturb and move your spirit.--Dorothy Roberts, Author, Killing the Black Body: Race, Reproduction, and the Meaning of Liberty<br><br>Bettina Judd's phenomenal debut poetry collection, Patient., is about recovery in many senses: recovery of the subjectivity of several historical figures, through the recovery, reconstitution, and telling of their stories--among them Anarcha Wescott, Betsey Harris, Lucy Zimmerman, Joice Heth, Saartjie Baartman, and Henrietta Lacks, who were infamously "patients" or subjects of inspection and "plunder" by, among others, J.

The new introduction by Brian Gibbons explores the plays in the context of early modern theatre, culture and politics, as well as examining their language, characters and themes. On-page commentary notes guide students to a better understanding and combine to make this an indispensable student edition ideal for study and classroom use from A Level upwards.</p><p>A collection of the four major plays by Christopher Marlowe: Tamburlaine, Parts 1 and 2, <i>The Jew of Malta, Edward II </i>and <i> Dr Faustus, </i>with a new introduction by Brian Gibbons. All of these plays are widely studied at both A and undergraduate level.<p>Christopher Marlowe (1564-93) was an English playwright and poet, who through his establishment of blank verse as a medium for drama did much to free the Elizabethan theatre from the constraints of the medieval and Tudor dramatic tradition. His first play <i>Tamburlaine the Great</i>, was performed that same year, probably by the Admiral's Men with Edward Alleyn in the lead. With its swaggering power-hungry title character and gorgeous verse the play proved to be enormously popular; Marlowe quickly wrote a second part, which may have been produced later that year. Marlowe's most famous play, <i>The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus</i>, based on the medieval German legend of the scholar who sold his soul to the devil, was probably written and produced by 1590, although it was not published until 1604. Historically the play is important for utilizing the soliloquy as an aid to character analysis and development. <i>The Jew of Malta</i> (<i>c. </i>1590) has another unscrupulous aspiring character at its centre in the Machiavellian Barabas. <i>Edward II</i> (<i>c. </i>1592), which may have influenced Shakespeare's Richard II, was highly innovatory in its treatment of a historical character and formed an important break with the more simplistic chronicle plays that had preceded it. Marlowe also wrote two lesser plays, <i>Dido, Queen of Carthage</i> (date unknown) and <i>The Massacre at Paris</i> (1593), based on contemporary events in France. Marlowe was killed in a London tavern in May 1593. Although Marlowe's writing career lasted for only six years, his four major plays make him easily the most important predecessor of Shakespeare.<br>Brian Gibbons is a distinguished scholar and editor of Shakespeare and other early modern dramatists.

This book offers a wealth of practical things you can do to stay connected with the Alzheimer's patient in your life. It offers straightforward suggestions and invaluable do's and don'ts, with advice on everything from dealing effectively with the inevitable repetition that occurs in conversations with an Alzheimer's patient to helpful strategies for saying no to unrealistic demands. It also includes thoughtful tips to remind you to take care of your own feelings and suggestions for helping children become comfortable with visiting an Alzheimer's sufferer.</p></p><p>Few books manage to balance practical suggestions and loving sympathy as well as <i>Talking to Alzheimer's</i>, a concise and comprehensive guide to communication with both paid caregivers and their patients. While the title suggests focus on a specific disease, the recommendations are appropriate for any family struggling with serious communication issues, whether those issues are the result of stroke, surgery, disease, or an accident. <p> Much of the book discusses methods of easing conversation during visits, as well as ways to manage the emotions that can surface in difficult times. From asking open-ended questions like, "How did your day go?" to gently reintroducing yourself to lifelong friends, the pointers here are written with kindness, and they focus on maintaining dignity for all involved. Short sections include tips on involving children in your visits and a welcome list of resources that spans organizations, Web sites, and additional books; this straightforward advice even includes expected response time to Web site inquiries. Instead of an index, you'll find a list of topics, so you can find immediate answers on "ending a conversation" and "when to insist." </p><p> One lengthy chapter covers the heartbreakers, such as dealing with refusals to eat or listening to tearful requests to be taken home. Author Claudia Strauss acknowledges the difficulty of these situations honestly, while at the same time providing simple words that can help diffuse the issues and open the path for joyful visits that benefit everyone involved. <i>--Jill Lightner</i></p>Learn the tools for effective, meaningful, and mutually rewarding communication with the person with Alzheimer's in your life. <p>"Talking to Alzheimer's is quite remarkable: sensitive and tender in its tone but also shrewd and useful. The whole book has this tenacious emphasis on genuine respectfulness; it all rings true and is written with so much informed respect for the loved person. I think it's a wise and lovely little book and I'm grateful to Claudia for writing it." - Jonathan Kozol, Alzheimer's family member and author of "Savage Inequalities, Amazing Grace", and "Ordinary Resurrections." </p><p>"This is clearly written and comprehensive book that addresses the common and uncommon issues that arise in caring for someone with Alzheimer disease. It is practical and never condescends. I highly recommend it to anyone who has a loved one suffering from dementia." - Peter V. Rabins, M.D. Professor of Psychiatry, The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, and author of "The 36-Hour Day." "I was so taken with this practical and warm approach to visiting and creating enjoyable and meaningful times with loved ones. Visiting is clearly recognized as an issue?and some families become so disappointed and disheartened that they stop coming. This targeted, doable book helps people come to terms with that they can really do." - Betty Ransom, Director of Education and Training for the National Capital Area Chapter of the Alzheimer's Association </p><p>"Talking to Alzheimer's is a winner and I know it will strike a resounding chord with anyone who has been there. Strauss' fresh, resourceful approach helps us find meaning and a spiritual connection when visiting, and puts words in our mouths that change the experience of visiting and being visited." -Lisa P. Gwyther, M.S.W., Director, Family Support Program, Duke University Center for Aging, founding member of the Alzheimer's Association.</p></p><h2>The Time Travelers (The Gideon Trilogy, Book 1)</h2><p>Previously published as GIDEON THE CUTPURSE <br> <br> 1763 <br> <br> Gideon Seymour, thief and gentleman, hides from the villainous Tar Man. Suddenly the sky peels away like fabric and from the gaping hole fall two curious-looking children. Peter Schock and Kate Dyer have fallen straight from the twenty-first century, thanks to an experiment with an antigravity machine. Before Gideon and the children have a chance to gather their wits, the Tar Man takes off with the machine -- and Peter and Kate's only chance of getting home. Soon Gideon, Peter, and Kate are swept into a journey through eighteenth-century London and form a bond that, they hope, will stand strong in the face of unfathomable treachery.</p><p>Linda Buckley-Archer is the author of the critically acclaimed Gideon trilogy. Originally trained as a linguist, she is now a full-time novelist and scriptwriter. She has written a television drama for the BBC and several radio dramas, as well as various journalistic pieces for papers like the <i>Independent</i>. The Gideon Trilogy was inspired by the criminal underworld of eighteenth-century London."The cliff-hanger ending leaves you longing for the next book." -- "The Independent", 10 Best Books for ages 8-12<br><br>"A time-slip novel, deftly handled. The year 1763 is beautifully evoked, as is the present day...Hard to imagine it being done better. A real find, leaving you hungry for more." -- Philip Ardagh, "The Guardian"<br><br>"There is much to recommend in this book. The 18th century is vividly and lovingly brought to life...There are many excellent characters (among them a truly repellent villain called The Tar Man), a swift pace and an absorbing plot. It's convincing and exciting and I loved it." -- "Publishing News", Bookseller's Choice<br><br>"The novel abounds with period detail, effortlessly woven into the plot...Tanglewreck, like Gideon the Cutpurse...is partly a satire on our current perception that we all have too little time to change the nature of reality, rather than our own greed and impatience. Neither should be missed." -- Amanda Craig, "The Times"<br><br>."..a wonderful time-travelling tale...a brilliant introduction to this period of history, evoked with gorgeous attention to detail and language." -- "The Book Magazine"<br><br>"Buckley-Archer may very well give J. K. Rowling a run for her money. This wonderfully rich and complex novel, written in lyrical and vivid language, is destined to be a classic. History interweaves with science, social issues in both centuries are thrown in; yet what readers will remember most is a fast-paced plot with a cliff-hanger ending and multi-dimensional characters who continue to inhabit their thoughts long after the book is closed. With appeal for reluctant and advanced readers, this novel is a rare gem." -- "School Library Journal", Starred Choice<br><br><p> "So convincing a picture of the 18th century that we feel transported ourselves, this first book of a planned trilogy of time-travel adventures is skilled, engrossing and irresistible. The reader, like the protagonists, will find it hard to return to the present." -- Nicolette Jones, "The Sunday Times", Children's Book of the Week<br><br>"A thrilling time-slip story." -- "Funday Times"<br><br></p><p> ."..a thrilling tale of dashing highwaymen and sinister villains. Full of flavour and witty flourishes, this should be a huge summer favourite." -- "The Bookseller", Bookseller's Choice<br><br>"Great fun and a really good adventure..." -- Kate Scarborough, "The Guardian"</p></p><h2>Creative Living: Bohemian Interiors Around the World</h2><p><i>Creative Living&nbsp;</i>sidesteps the world of carefully constructed interior design images, instead diving into the liberated and nonconformist atmosphere of offbeat beauty and artistic delights.

A melting pot of the Borscht Belt, sports, and show-biz worlds, loyal visitors included Red Buttons, Rocky Marciano, Eddie Fisher, and Jackie Robinson. Tania Grossinger grew up there. In her fascinating insider's account of life in the hospitality industry, she sheds light on how hotel children keep up with the frenetic pace of life, and how they come to grips with the outside world (which intrudes now and again), sex (happening in every room), and, occasionally, their intellectual interests. Growing Up at Grossinger's is both a wonderful coming-of-age story and a sentimental reading of a chapter of the Jewish experience in America that has now closed. 25 b/w photographs.<br><br>Skyhorse Publishing, along with our Arcade, Good Books, Sports Publishing, and Yucca imprints, is proud to publish a broad range of biographies, autobiographies, and memoirs.

Patrick Clarke is ten. He loves Geronimo, the Three Stooges, and the smell of his hot water bottle. He can't stand his little brother Sinbad. His best friend is Kevin, and their names are all over Barrytown, written with sticks in wet cement. They play football, lepers, and jumping to the bottom of the sea. But why didn't anyone help him when Charles Leavy had been going to kill him? Why do his ma and da argue so much, but act like everything is fine? Paddy sees everything, but he understands less and less. Hilarious and poignant, <i>Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha</i> charts the triumphs, indignities, and bewilderment of a young boy and his world, a place full of warmth, cruelty, confusion and love.</p><p>In Roddy Doyle's Booker Prize-winning novel <i>Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha</i>, an Irish lad named Paddy rampages through the streets of Barrytown with a pack of like-minded hooligans, playing cowboys and Indians, etching their names in wet concrete, and setting fires. Roddy Doyle has captured the sensations and speech patterns of preadolescents with consummate skill, and managed to do so without resorting to sentimentality. Paddy Clarke and his friends are not bad boys; they're just a little bit restless. They're always taking sides, bullying each other, and secretly wishing they didn't have to. All they want is for something--<i>anything</i>--to happen. <p> Throughout the novel, Paddy teeters on the nervous verge of adolescence. In one scene, Paddy tries to make his little brother's hot water bottle explode, but gives up after stomping on it just one time: "I jumped on Sinbad's bottle. Nothing happened. I didn't do it again. Sometimes when nothing happened it was really getting ready to happen." Paddy Clarke senses that his world is about to change forever--and not necessarily for the better. When he realizes that his parents' marriage is falling apart, Paddy stays up all night listening, half-believing that his vigil will ward off further fighting. It doesn't work, but it is sweet and sad that he believes it might. Paddy's logic may be fuzzy, but his heart is in the right place. <i>--Jill Marquis</i></p>The 1993 Booker Prize winner. Paddy Clarke, a ten-year-old Dubliner, describes his world, a place full of warmth, cruelty, love, sardines and slaps across the face. He&#39;s confused; he sees everything but he understands less and less.</p><h2>The Four Arcanes: The Complete Arcane Collection of Four Books (The Arcane Teaching, Arcane Formulas, Vril &amp; The Mystery of Sex)</h2><p>This volume puts together for the first time in one volume, the Four Arcanes, the amazing books written by William Walker Atkinson about the Wisdom of the Ages, or " Arcane Teaching" The volumes are: The Arcane Teaching, The Arcane Formulas, Vril (Vital Magnetism) &amp; The Mystery of Sex. Says Atkinson that &#x201c;The Arcane Teaching has come down to the present age through the corridors of time, from the dim ages of past eras, races, and schools of thought. Even those highest in the councils of &#x201c;The Custodians of The Scroll,&#x201d; are unable to trace the Teaching, in an unbroken direct line, further back than the time of Pythagoras (about 500 b. c.), and a little later in Ancient Greece, although they find many references to, and extracts from, the teachings of ancient Egypt and Chaldea, which serve to show that the Pythagorean and Ancient Grecian Arcane Schools were founded on occult instruction still more remote, received in a direct line of succession of teachers and pupils extending over centuries. Investigators have found traces of the Arcane Teaching in the records of Persia and Medea, and it is believed that the inspiration for the original philosophical teaching (not the religion or the pessimism, however) of Gautama, the founder of Buddhism, was received from Arcane sources. Traces are also to be found in the Hebrew Esoteric Teachings of the &#x201c;Kabbalah&#x201d; and the &#x201c;Zohar.&#x201d;The Grecian Arcane Teaching was undoubtedly obtained directly from Egyptian sources through Pythagoras, the relation between the early Grecian teaching and philosophies, and the older school of old Egypt, being very close and intimate. Pythagoras is known to have received instruction from Egyptian and Persian hierophants. Besides the traditions of the Arcanes, there is to be found the closest resemblance between the ancient Grecian teachings, and those of the Egyptian Esoteric Fraternities. Some of the Teachers, however, hold that the Grecian and Egyptian schools, respectively, were but two separate off shoots of an original and older Teaching which had its origin in the lost continent of Atlantis. There are many Arcane traditions connecting the Teaching with Atlantis, and it is possible that both Egypt and Greece received it from this common source, instead of Greece being indebted to Egypt for the line of transmission. But, be this as it may, it is a fact that all of the traces of teaching that the various occult schools gather from the traditions, scraps of doctrine, and legends regarding Atlantis can be reconciled with the Grecian Arcane Teaching.&#x201d;</p><p></p><h2>A Pocket Guide to Catholic Apologetics</h2><p>Now ? at your fingertips ? is the biblical basis for the key Catholic teachings and customs that non-Catholics wonder about, object to, and preach against.

Kaveh Akbar seems able to contain both--he's a demotic, as well as a spiritual, poet (the only type of either I trust). Each word in this little book might rise up from somewhere deep in the earth, but they turn into stars." - Nick Flynn</p> <p>"In Islam prayer is not transactional, poetry is not divorced from the quotidian and portraiture is embraced only in the abstract. And yet here in Kaveh Akbar's book, entreaty is earnest, aimed at the human and particular more often than the divine but at the same time the language and form elevate themselves to the fevered register of desperation. Yes, sure, fine, you would think that a Muslim writing about being a drunk would have to adopt unconventional approaches, but drunkenness in the Islamic literary tradition is a long and time-honored metaphor. For what? Abandonment to God, a cessation of the self--but not so here; no. Here it's real, it's coarse, it's dangerous. The reason we Muslims do not pray <em>for</em> things is that it is similarly dangerous for one to call God's attention onto oneself. But for Kaveh Akbar, whose very name <em>means</em> 'poetry, ' it is a risk every poem takes with gusto. And speaking purely for myself, these poems give me life because 'for so long every step I've taken/ has been from one tongue to another.' Be careful, little brother. God's got His eye on you now." - Kazim Ali</p> <p> </p></p><p></p><h2>Diet for a Hot Planet: The Climate Crisis at the End of Your Fork and What You Can Do about It</h2><p><p>Nearly four decades after her mother, Frances Moore Lapp�, published <i>Diet for a Small Planet</i>, sparking a revolution in our thinking about the social and environmental impact of our food choices, Anna Lapp� picks up the conversation, examining another hidden cost of our food system: the climate crisis. From raising cattle in industrial-scale feedlots to razing rainforests to make palm oil for Pop-Tarts, the choices we make about how we put food on our plates, and what we do with the waste, contribute to as much as one third of total greenhouse-gas emissions.

Her testimony before investigating committees revealed the extent to which communist infiltration had taken place in America, particularly among teachers in schools and colleges. This record of her life describes how she came to be a member of the Communist Party, the reasons for her gradual disillusionment and final break with the party, and her eventual return to the Catholic Church into which she was born.</p> <p>Her conversion to Communism was a slow usurpation of the mind by an appeal to love of humanity, a vision of a better society, and wider social justice. In time she became a member of the Party&#x2019;s National Committee, and was intensely active in combating the Rapp-Coudert investigation of communist teachers, in supporting Loyalist Spain, and in the &#x201c;united democratic front&#x201d; maintained during World War II. But she was gradually repelled by the dictatorial methods of the Party and the constant struggle for power. Her divorce from her husband, and her own ill health speeded her estrangement from Party leaders and resulted in her expulsion from the Party in 1949.</p> <p>Dodd&#x2019;s re-entrance into the Catholic Church&#x2014;which as a communist she had so bitterly attacked&#x2014;was a natural result of her new state of mind. In the early 1950s, she provided detailed explanations of the Communist subversion of the Church, reporting that &#x201c;in the 1930s we put eleven hundred men into the priesthood in order to destroy the Church from within, [and that] right now they are in the highest places in the Church.&#x201d; From such positions they were working to bring about change in order to weaken the Church&#x2019;s effectiveness against Communism. She said further that these changes would be so drastic that &#x201c;you will not recognize the Catholic Church.&#x201d;</p> <p>Bella Dodd&#x2019;s story is a human document of immense importance to Americans today. Here are the inner workings of the Communist Party in the United States in the early to mid-20th century as seen from the secret counsels and strategy meetings of the National Committee, to which she belonged for a crucial span of years. The climax of the book is a snowy Christmas Eve when Bella finds the reaffirmation of her faith, and is able to say, &#x201c;I have learned from bitter experience that you cannot serve man unless you first serve God in sincerity and truth.&#x201d; Not being able to secure her baptismal certificate from Italy after inquiry, she was baptized by Bishop Fulton J. Sheen in St. Patrick&#x2019;s Cathedral, New York.</p></p><p></p><h2>Judge Dredd 4: The Complete Case Files (Judge Dredd: The Complete Case Files)</h2><p>IN MEGA-CITY ONE CRIME DOESN&#x2019;T PAY!

The plays in this volume all contain Aristophanes' trademark bawdy comedy and dazzling verbal agility. In <i>The Birds</i>, two cunning Athenians persuade the birds to build the utopian city of 'Much Cuckoo in the Clouds' in the sky, blockading the Olympian gods and installing themselves as new deities.<i> The Knights</i> is a venomous satire on Cleon, a prominent Athenian demagogue, who vies with a humble sausage-seller for the approval of the people; while <i>The Assembly-Women</i> deals with the battle of the sexes as the women of Athens infiltrate the all-male Assembly in disguise. The lengthy conflict with Sparta is the subject of <i>Peace</i>, inspired by the hope of a settlement in 421 BC, and <i>Wealth</i> reflects on the economic catastrophe that hit Athens after the war. <br><br> These lively translations by David Barrett and Alan H. Sommerstein capture the full humour of the plays. The introduction examines Aristophanes' life and times, and the comedy and poetry of his works, and this edition also includes an introductory note for each play.&nbsp;<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

He was twice threatened with prosecution in the 420s for his outspoken attacks on the prominent politician Cleon, but in 405 he was publicly honored and crowned for promoting Athenian civic unity in<i>&nbsp;The Frogs</i>. Aristophanes had his first comedy produced when he was about twenty-one, and wrote forty plays in all. The eleven surviving plays of Aristophanes are published in the Penguin Classics series as&nbsp;<i>The Birds and Other Plays</i>,&nbsp;<i>Lysistrata and Other Plays</i>, and&nbsp;<i>The Wasps/The Poet</i>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<i>Women/The Frogs</i>.<br><br><b>David Barrett</b> has translated a number of ancient Greek texts for Penguin Classics.Text: English (translation) <br> Original Language: Greek</p><h2>Who God Says You Are: A Christian Understanding of Identity</h2><p><p><b>WHO ARE YOU?</b>&nbsp;</p><p>For respected New Testament scholar Klyne Snodgrass, this is the most important question a person can ask&#x2014;the question from which everything else in life flows.

Without inner peace there is no real happiness at all. Problems, suffering and unhappiness do not exist outside the mind; they are feelings and thus part of our mind. Therefore, it is only by controlling our mind that we can permanently stop our problems and make ourself and others truly happy. The twenty-one Buddhist meditation practices presented in this book are actual methods to control our mind and experience lasting inner peace. This extremely practical guide is an indispensable handbook for those seeking happiness and meaning in their lives.</p></p><p><p>Venerable Geshe Kelsang Gyatso is a fully accomplished meditation master and internationally renowned teacher of Buddhism who has pioneered the introduction of modern Buddhism into contemporary society.

The practice of meditation is a method for familiarizing our mind with virtue. the more familiar our mind is with virtue, the calmer and more peaceful it becomes. When our mind is peaceful, we are free from worries and mental discomfort, and we experience true happiness. If we train our mind to become peaceful we will be happy all the time, even in the most adverse conditions. But if our mind is not peaceful, then even if we have the most pleasant external conditions we will not be happy. Therefore, it is important to train our mind through meditation.</p><h2>Midnight Secretary, Vol. 1 (1)</h2><p>Mad Men meets Vampire Diaries<br><br>Kaya Satozuka prides herself on being an excellent secretary and a consummate professional, so she doesn&#x2019;t even bat an eye when she&#x2019;s reassigned to the office of her company&#x2019;s difficult director, Kyohei Touma.

Synchronicity, the Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung had called it. A confluence of seemingly unrelated events that have meaning&#x2014;albeit hidden to all but the most discerning. It was a sophisticated concept, especially for a Western mind, Kuan-Yin Zhao thought.</p><p>Of course, there were corollaries in his own life. Xiangqi, one of his passions, was an exercise in manipulated synchronicity. At its heart, the mastery of Xiangqi, and its lesser cousin, chess, was nothing more than recognizing the patterns your opponent was trying to hide, and creating patterns your opponent will fail to see until too late. Great Xiangqi players never move a single piece. On the board, it may be a <i>pao</i> moving five squares, but in the mind of a master, it is the <i>pao</i>&#x2019;s move, combined with the myriad moves available to his opponent, combined with a countermove, and so on until victory or defeat.</p><p>Though pleased that Xiangqi might inspire a solution to his dilemma, he was also unsurprised. All he&#x2019;d needed was the hint of an opening move, and now he had it. From there his mind would expand across the board&#x2014;or in this case, across nations.</p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p><b>IF</b> not for an underling&#x2019;s father who had left China thirty years earlier to find greener pastures, he would have never found the linchpin of his plan.

How can God expect us to be holy as he is? But thanks to what Christ has accomplished on our behalf, God accepts us because of his Son&#x2019;s righteousness. Yet the call to holiness remains.&nbsp;</p><p>In this redesigned edition of his book, preacher and teacher Bryan Chapell puts good works and obedience in proper perspective. He traces the relationship of holiness and grace in three parts, outlining the principles of grace, the practices of faith, and the motives of love.

Yet, though we give this teaching lip service, very few ministers and Christians know how grace-based sanctification really works. Bryan Chapell has produced a popular, practical, yet theologically sensitive book on this very issue&#x2015;how God&#x2019;s gracious acceptance is the dynamic and guide for growth into holy character. This is a great book&#x2015;an extremely timely book.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Timothy Keller,</strong>&nbsp;Founding Pastor, Redeemer Presbyterian Church, New York City; Chairman and Cofounder, Redeemer City to City</p><p>&#x201c;With the skill of a surgeon and the joy of a child, Bryan Chapell invites us to walk in a garden of grace.

We have an entire vocabulary of adjectives to describe it when we sing about it. And yet&#x2015;if the truth be told&#x2015;we Christians either have a stubborn tendency to refuse really to believe it, or we stumble over its implications.

Packer,</strong> Board of Governors' Professor of Theology, Regent College</p><p>&#x201c;What a great book! What a necessary book! What a life-changing book! A lack of God&#x2019;s clear desire for holiness in His people doesn&#x2019;t come from making the gospel too good . . . it comes from not making it good enough. This is the book for which I have long prayed, and I enthusiastically commend it to you. If you miss it, you&#x2019;ll be sorry.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Steve Brown,</strong>&nbsp;Host, <em>Key Life</em> Radio Program; author, <em>Three Free Sins: God Isn't Mad At You&nbsp;</em></p><p>&#x201c;It should not be thought of as extraordinary that a book on the subject of holiness puts its focus on the word 'delight.' The very crowning of God&#x2019;s creation was the placing of his holy creatures, Adam and Eve, in the garden named Eden, which simply means 'delight.' Dr. Chapell makes it clear that the soul&#x2019;s delight will be realized only by godliness in the Christian life&#x2015;and that, of course, is what the gift of grace is all about. A scholarly and practical study of 'the beauty of holiness.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>The Late D. James Kennedy</strong>, Former Senior Minister, Coral Ridge Presbyterian Church</p><p>&#x201c;<em>Holiness by Grace</em> addresses the tension between human responsibility and divine provision in the process of our sanctification. Dr. Bryan Chapell guides us through these tensions by assuring us again and again of God&#x2019;s mercy and grace that not only secures our ways to him, but also provides our daily motivation and enablement to serve him. The questions at the end are designed to delve more deeply into these truths leading us in our service to God with the acknowledgment that God must provide what we need to please him. We can never hear enough about God&#x2019;s grace. This book is a fresh reminder.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Rose Marie Miller</strong>, missionary; author, <em>From Fear to Freedom</em></p><p>&#x201c;This is a delightful book, full of sane, practical theology and application. It is not the sort of book that will satisfy armchair theologians pondering exactly how the Mosaic covenant relates to the new covenant; rather, it is the sort of book that teaches Christians how to live&#x2015;aiming for holiness and delighting in it, responding to grace and being thankful for it, avoiding the countless pitfalls, and learning to please God.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>D. A. Carson,</strong>&nbsp;Emeritus Professor of New Testament, Trinity Evangelical Divinity School; Cofounder, The Gospel Coalition</p><p>&#x201c;The classic Puritan pastor Richard Sibbes was called 'the heavenly Doctor Sibbes' due in part to his God-given ability to make sovereign grace clear to the spiritually sick and weak and wounded. In that same way, Dr. Chapell is a 'heavenly physical therapist' for in these pages he carefully instructs a church wounded and weak by theological error of the restorative and healing truth of Reformed sanctification. This volume helps the weary walk more holy.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Joseph V. Novenson,&nbsp;</strong>Pastor, Lookout Mountain Presbyterian Church, Lookout Mountain, Tennessee</p><p>&#x201c;<em>Holiness by Grace</em> is a biblical and doctrinal introduction to grace-based godliness&#x2015;a guide for recovering Pharisees. Bryan Chapell has a special ability to teach the Bible in a way that refreshes the heart. This book will help you see yourself the way God sees you, so that you can serve him the way he wants to be served.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Philip Graham Ryken,</strong> President, Wheaton College</p><p>&#x201c;<em>Holiness by Grace</em> is a wonderfully clear, biblically nuanced presentation of what it means to truly grow in the grace of God. Chapell is Christ-centered without allowing modern grace movements to become reactions to older legalism. The church needs this book both to correct errors and to guide people more faithfully into the proven paths of the past.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>John H. Armstrong,</strong> Director of Act 3; author, <em>The Compromised Church</em></p><p>&#x201c;Dr. Bryan Chapell has done a masterful job of demonstrating that a rigorous proclamation of the gospel of God&#x2019;s grace is not only consistent with a call to holy living, it is the only effective way to enable Christian believers to live out that call. I was personally enriched by his careful use of Scripture as the foundation for the teaching of each chapter. I pray that his influence will give us a generation of preachers who know how to preach grace.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Stephen E. Smallman,</strong> Assistant Pastor, New Life Presbyterian Church, Glenside, Pennsylvania; Instructor, CityNet Ministries of Philadelphia; author, <em>Spiritual Birthline</em>, <em>Forty Days on the Mountain</em>, and <em>The Walk</em></p><p>&#x201c;The role of God&#x2019;s grace in Christian sanctification is so little understood among believers today. Bryan Chapell deftly brings the light of Scripture to bear on this troublesome question through careful exposition and compelling illustrations. I highly recommend this book.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Jerry Bridges</strong>, author, <em>The Pursuit of Holiness</em></p></p><h2>Pierced for Our Transgressions: Rediscovering the Glory of Penal Substitution</h2><p><p>The belief that Jesus died for us, suffering the wrath of his own Father in our place, has been the wellspring of hope for countless Christians through the ages. However, with an increasing number of theologians, church leaders, and even popular Christian books and magazines questioning this doctrine, which naysayers have described as a form of "cosmic child abuse," a fresh articulation and affirmation of penal substitution is needed.

With great passion and enthusiasm, he reveals Siberia's role in history&#x2015;its science, economics, and politics&#x2015;and tells the stories of its most famous exiles, such as Dostoyevsky, Lenin, and Stalin. At the same time, Frazier draws a unique portrait of Russia since the end of the Soviet Union, and gives a personal account of adventure among Russian friends and acquaintances. A unique, captivating, totally Frazierian take on what he calls the "amazingness" of Russia&#x2015;<i>Travels in Siberia </i>is "a masterpiece of nonfiction writing&#x2015;tragic, bizarre, and funny" (<i>San Francisco Chronicle</i>).</p></p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, October 2010</strong>: Over 20 years after <em>Great Plains</em>, one of the more oddly wonderful books of the last few decades, Ian Frazier takes us to another territory worthy of his expansive curiosity: the vast eastern stretches of Russia known as Siberia. Through the stories of Russian friends, Frazier was drawn there in the early '90s, and he soon fell in love with the country--an "embarrassing" sort of middle-aged love, an involuntary infection. What he loves is its tragedy and its humor, its stoic practicality and its near-insanity: he calls it "the greatest horrible country in the world," and Siberia is its swampy, often-frozen, and strikingly empty backyard. He took five trips there over the next dozen or so years, and <em>Travels in Siberia</em> is based on those journeys. But as in <em>Great Plains</em>, when Frazier travels he follows his own curiosity through time as well as space, telling stories of the Mongols and the Decembrists with the same amused and empathetic eye he brings to his own traveling companions. His curiosity quickly becomes yours, as does his affection for this immense and grudgingly hospitable land. <em>--Tom Nissley</em><p><b>Ian Frazier</b> is the author of <i>Great Plains, The Fish's Eye, On the Rez</i>, and <i>Family</i>, as well as <i>Coyote v.

Slavoj i ek has identified the four horsemen of this coming apocalypse: the worldwide ecological crisis; imbalances within the economic system; the biogenetic revolution; and exploding social divisions and ruptures. But, he asks, if the end of capitalism seems to many like the end of the world, how is it possible for Western society to face up to the end times? In a major new analysis of our global situation, Slavok i ek argues that our collective responses to economic Armageddon correspond to the stages of grief: ideological denial, explosions of anger and attempts at bargaining, followed by depression and withdrawal.<br><br>After passing through this zero-point, we can begin to perceive the crisis as a chance for a new beginning. Or, as Mao Zedong put it, &#x201c;There is great disorder under heaven, the situation is excellent.&#x201d; Slavoj i ek shows the cultural and political forms of these stages of ideological avoidance and political protest, from New Age obscurantism to violent religious fundamentalism. Concluding with a compelling argument for the return of a Marxian critique of political economy, i ek also divines the wellsprings of a potentially communist culture&#x2014;from literary utopias like Kafka&#x2019;s community of mice to the collective of freak outcasts in the TV series <i>Heroes</i>.</p><p><b>Slavoj &#x17d;i&#x17e;ek</b> is a Slovenian philosopher and cultural critic.

Focusing on the inevitable maturing of families and their firms over time, the authors reveal the dynamics and challenges family businesses face as they move through their life cycles. The book asks questions, such as: what is the difference between an entrepreneurial start-up and a family business, and how does one become the other? How does the meaning of the business to the family change as adults and children age? How do families move through generational changes in leadership, from anticipation to transfer, and then separation and retirement? This book is divided into three sections that present a multidimensional model of a family business. The authors use the model to explore the various stages in the family business life span and extract generalizable lessons about how family businesses should be organized.</p><p><b>Kelin E.

Norwich presents such popes as Innocent I, who in the fifth century successfully negotiated with Alaric the Goth, an invader civil authorities could not defeat; Leo I, who two decades later tamed (and perhaps paid off) Attila the Hun; the infamous &#x201c;pornocracy&#x201d;&#x2014;the five libertines who were descendants or lovers of Marozia, debauched daughter of one of Rome&#x2019;s most powerful families; Pope Paul III, &#x201c;the greatest pontiff of the sixteenth century,&#x201d; who reinterpreted the Church&#x2019;s teaching and discipline; John XXIII, who in five short years starting in 1958 instituted reforms that led to Vatican II; and Benedict XVI, who is coping with today&#x2019;s global priest sex scandal.

I will give unto thee the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven."&nbsp; On those few words - the Latin version of which is inscribed around the base of the dome of St Peter's - rests the entire structure of the Roman Catholic Church. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The name Peter is so familiar to us today that it comes as something of a surprise to learn that until those words were uttered it was not a name at all, but a perfectly ordinary noun:&nbsp; the Aramaic<i> kephas</i>, translated into the Greek<i> petros</i>, meaning a rock or stone.&nbsp; There seems little doubt that Jesus did indeed bestow it upon Simon;&nbsp; the fact is confirmed by St Mark, and also (albeit writing some time afterwards) by St John, although the two admittedly disagree about the actual occasion when the event occurred.&nbsp; Matthew's, however, is the only gospel that adds Jesus's stated reason for the choice of name, and it is this addition that has led scholars to suggest that the whole passage may be a later interpolation.&nbsp; The very fact that it does not appear in the other gospels has struck some of them as suspicious -though there are plenty of other incidents that are reported by only one of the evangelists and have gone unques�tioned.&nbsp; A stronger objection is that the word for "church" - the Greek<i> ecclesia</i> - occurs only twice in all four gospels, its other appearance[i] being in a context that is suspect for other reasons.&nbsp; In any event, would Jesus really be thinking at this early stage of founding a church?&nbsp; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;If Jesus never uttered the words at all, then the Roman Catholic Church, far from being founded on a rock, rests on very shaky foundations indeed.&nbsp; But even if he did, another question remains:&nbsp; what precisely did he mean?&nbsp; Was Peter, having established the Church, to be followed by an infinite number of successors, each in turn inheriting Peter's own apostolic commission?&nbsp; And if so, in what capacity?&nbsp; Not, certainly, as Bishops of Rome, a city which Christ never mentioned - to him Jerusalem was far more important.&nbsp; The evidence, such as it is, suggests that he meant nothing of the kind.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And what happened to Peter anyway?&nbsp; The New Testament tells us virtually nothing, either about him or about his colleague St Paul.&nbsp; According to a very early tradition, they were both in Rome in the year 64 AD, when a terrifying fire raged through the city.&nbsp; The Emperor Nero was accused of "fiddling", or singing to his lute, during the conflagration, and was later rumoured to have started it himself.&nbsp; Tacitus tells us that<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to be rid of this rumour, Nero fastened the guilt on a class hated for their abominations, which the populace called Christians.&nbsp; Mockery of every sort accompanied their deaths.&nbsp; Covered with the skins of beasts, they were torn apart by dogs and so perished.&nbsp; Others were nailed to crosses or consumed by the flames.&nbsp; Nero even threw open his garden for the spectacle and mounted a performance in the circus.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to that same tradition, both Peter and Paul were among the victims.&nbsp; The Acts of the Apostles, however - written, almost certainly after these per�secutions, by St Luke, whom we know to have accom�panied Paul to Rome - is once again maddeningly uninformative.&nbsp; It does not even mention Paul's martyrdom, merely remarking in its penultimate verse that he stayed in the city for two years;&nbsp; As for Peter, he fades out of the book for ever halfway through Chapter XII, when we are told, quite simply, that "he departed, and went to another place".&nbsp; The spotlight then turns on Paul, and remains on him till the end.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are so many questions that Luke could have answered.&nbsp; Was Peter indeed crucified head downwards, at his request?&nbsp; Was he even crucified at all?&nbsp; Did he ever actually travel to Rome?&nbsp; He certainly had good reason to, simply because to him was entrusted the mission to the Jews, and - with some 30-40,000 Jews living in Rome at that time - the embryonic Roman Church would have been very largely Jewish.&nbsp; But nowhere in the New Testament is there any evidence that he went to Rome at all.&nbsp; He certainly does not seem to have been there when Paul wrote his Epistle to the Romans, probably in 58 AD.&nbsp; The final chapter of the Epistle gives a long list of names to whom the writer sends his greetings;&nbsp; the name of Peter is not among them.&nbsp; If, then, he did indeed meet his death in Rome, he could not have been there for very long - certainly not long enough to found the Roman Church, which in any case had already begun to take shape.&nbsp; It is worth pointing out, too, that there is no contemporary or even near-contemporary reference to Peter as having been a bishop;&nbsp; nor, according to all the indications, was there even a bishop in Rome before the second century.[ii]<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are however two pieces of evidence that suggest that Peter did indeed visit the capital and die there, though neither is altogether conclusive.&nbsp; The first comes from his own First Epistle, the penultimate verse of which contains the words "She [presumably the Church, such as it was] that is in Babylon..... salu�teth you".&nbsp; This is at first sight nonsense, until we discover that Babylon was a recognised symbolic name for Rome, used in this sense no less than four times in the Book of Revelation.&nbsp; The second testimony comes in a letter from a certain Clement, a Roman presbyter, or elder of the Church - he usually appears as third or fourth in the list of Popes - who seems to have known St Peter personally[iii].&nbsp; It was written in about 96 AD to the Church at Corinth, where a serious dispute had arisen.&nbsp; The key passage here (in Chapter V) reads: "Let us set before our eyes our good apostles:&nbsp; Peter, who because of unrighteous jealousy suffered not one or two but many trials, and having thus given his testimony went to the glorious place which was his due.&nbsp; Through jealousy and strife Paul demonstrated how to win the prize of patient endurance:&nbsp; seven times he was imprisoned;&nbsp; he was forced to leave and stoned;&nbsp; he preached in the East and the West;&nbsp; and, finally, he won the splendid renown which his faith had earned."&nbsp; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why, we ask ourselves for the thousandth time, did the early fathers have to do quite so much beating about the bush?&nbsp; Why could they not say in so many words that people were martyred or crucified?&nbsp; But there:&nbsp; we know that Paul met his death during the persecutions under Nero - Tertullian tells us that he was beheaded - and the way Clement mentions the two in almost the same breath strongly suggests that Peter met a similar fate.&nbsp; All that can be said for sure is that by the middle of the second century - which could well be during the lifetime of the grandchildren of people who had actually known them - it was generally accepted that Peter and Paul had both been martyred in Rome.&nbsp; There were even two places associated with their martyrdom:&nbsp; and not specifically Christian burial-places like the Catacombs either, but non-denominational cemeteries, one in the Vatican, the other outside the walls on the road to Ostia.&nbsp; <br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; * &nbsp;&nbsp;*<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When, in about 320 AD, the Roman Emperor Constantine the Great decided to build a basilica dedicated to St Peter on the Vatican Hill, he was clearly determined to build it on that precise spot and nowhere else.&nbsp; This caused him appalling difficulties.&nbsp; Instead of settling for the more or less level ground at the base of the hill, he chose a site on a steep slope - a decision which involved cutting away a vast mass of the hillside above, and constructing three heavy parallel walls beneath, the spaces between them densely packed with earth.&nbsp; Moreover the chosen site was already a huge necropolis, teeming with burial-places, and was still in use.&nbsp; Hundreds of tombs must have been destroyed, thousands of bodies desecrated.&nbsp; There was no time for demolition:&nbsp; the buildings simply had their roofs removed, after which they were filled with rubble to make a foundation for the new basilica - a practice, incidentally, which proved a blessing to twentieth-century archaeologists.&nbsp; The&nbsp; orientation of the Emperor's new building was also curious:&nbsp; the liturgical east end faced due west.&nbsp; For all this, there can have been only one reason:&nbsp; Constantine built directly over the spot where he believed the bones of St Peter to lie.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Was he right?&nbsp; Well, he may have been.&nbsp; We have one more piece of near-contemporary evidence.&nbsp; The historian Eusebius[iv] quotes a Roman priest named Gaius, who wrote in about 200 AD:&nbsp; "If you go to the Vatican or to the Ostian Way, there you find the trophies (<i>tropaia</i>) of those who founded this Church."&nbsp; The Ostian Way refers to St Paul and does not concern us here;&nbsp; but the Vatican refeence surely suggests some sort of memorial -<i> tropaion</i> means a monument of victory or triumph - to St Peter that was clearly visible on the Vatican Hill, at that time an open cemetery.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Excavations undertaken in the<i> sacre grotte</i> - the crypt of the basilica, below the floor of the Constantinian church - during and immediately after the Second World War revealed a two-tiered, three-niched construction, usually known as the<i> aedicula</i> and datable to 160-170 AD.&nbsp; In front of it are several earlier burial-places - a fact which may well be more significant than first appears.&nbsp; Since these contain no tombs or sarcophagi we cannot be sure whether they are Christian or pagan;&nbsp; we know however that in Rome, up to at least the middle of the second century, bodies were normally cremated;&nbsp; the absence of cremations from this particular corner of the old cemetery suggests that it may have been reserved for people holding special beliefs, in which case they were most probably Chris�tians.&nbsp; Moreover, the presence of a considerable number of votive coins - a few from as early as the first century - strongly suggests that here was a much-visited shrine. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For reasons too long and complicated to go into here[v], the<i> aedicula</i> is now generally believed to be Gaius's "trophy".&nbsp; Pope Pius XII, however, went a good deal further when, in his 1950 Christmas Message, he confidently claimed it to be the burial-place of St Peter.&nbsp; Such certainly seems to have been the generally-held belief in Rome towards the end of the second century;&nbsp; but, perhaps inevitably, there have been objections.&nbsp; Peter was not, as Paul was, a highly sophisticated Roman citizen;&nbsp; he was an uneducated Galilean fisherman.&nbsp; If he had been executed - whether or not by crucifixion - his body would normally have been thrown into the Tiber and would have been difficult indeed to recover.&nbsp; If he had met his death by fire among the countless other victims of Nero's per�secutions, his remains are still less likely to have survived.&nbsp; Perhaps, then, it is more probable that the<i> aedicula</i> was intended as a sort of cenotaph, a memorial rather than a mausoleum.&nbsp; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We can speculate for ever;&nbsp; but we shall never know for sure.&nbsp; Nor, on the other hand, is it really necessary that we should.&nbsp; Even if that enigmatic little construc�tion has no connection with him at all, St Peter m...</p><h2>Sleep Affirmations: 200 Phrases for a Deep and Peaceful Sleep</h2><p>The perfect bedside companion, with 200 affirmations that will help you get to sleep&#x2014;and stay asleep&#x2014;and wake up refreshed.<br><br>One out of three American adults have trouble getting to sleep each night&#x2014;chances are you&#x2019;ve spent some nights either tossing and turning, or waking up in the middle of the night and not being able to get back to sleep.<br> <br>This book helps you get into the best mindset for sleep, allowing you to enjoy deeper, more restful sleep through the power of 200 short affirmations, easily accessible in a flip-through format.

Following the 50th anniversary of the publication of his ground-breaking &#34;Things Fall Apart&#34;, Everyman republish Achebe&#39;s first and most famous novel alongside &#34;No Longer at Ease&#34; and &#34;Arrow of God&#34;, under the collective title &#34;The African Trilogy&#34;. In &#34;Things Fall Apart&#34; the individual tragedy of Okonkwo, &#39;strong man&#39; and tribal elder in the Nigeria of the 1890s is intertwined with the transformation of traditional Igbo society under the impact of Christianity and colonialism. In &#34;No Longer at Ease&#34;, Okonkwo&#39;s grandson, Obi, educated in England, returns to a civil-service job in colonial Lagos, only to clash with the ruling elite to which he now believes he belongs. Arrow of God is set in the 1920s and explores the conflict from the two points of view - often, but not always, opposing - of Ezuelu, an Igbo priest, and Captain Winterbottom, a British district officer. In spare and lucid prose, Achebe tellsa universal tale of personal and moral struggle in a changing world which continues to resonate in Africa today and has captured the imaginations of readers everywhere.</p><p>Born in 1930, Nigerian novelist and poet Chinua Achebe is probably black Africa&#39;s most widely read novelist. His first work, Things Fall Apart, is regarded as a classic of world literature and has been translated into 40 languages. Introducer Biography: Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie grew up in Nigeria and now lives in the United States. She is the author of Purple Hibiscus, Half of a Yellow Sunand The Thing Around Your Neck.I N T R O D U C T I O N <br>BY CHIMAMANDA NGOZI ADICHIE <br> <br>&#x2014;&#x2014; <br> <br>When, in 1958, the London publishers William Heinemann received a manuscript of Chinua Achebe&#x2019;s <i>Things Fall Apart</i>, they were unsure whether to publish it. The central question, according to editor Alan Hill, was this: &#x2018;Would anyone possibly buy a novel by an African?&#x2019; Not only were there a mere handful of examples of African writing in English at the time &#x2013; such as Amos Tutuola&#x2019;s surreal The Palm-Wine Drinkard and Cyprian Ekwensi&#x2019;s novel of contemporary Lagos, People of the City &#x2013; but none of them had the ambition, the subtlety, or the confidence of Things Fall Apart. <br> <br>Chinua Achebe had initially conceived it as a story of three generations: a man in pre-colonial Igboland who struggles against the changes brought by the first European missionaries and administrators; his son who converts to Christianity and receives some Western education; and his grandson who is educated in England and is living the life of the new elite on the cusp of independence. Achebe later scaled down the novel, focusing only on the first generation, to produce a carefully observed story of the African European colonial encounter set among the Igbo people of south-eastern Nigeria in the 1890s, with the tragic hero Okonkwo at its center. Achebe&#x2019;s second novel, No Longer at Ease, would skip a generation and tell the story of Okonkwo&#x2019;s grandson, Obi, a civil servant in 1950s Lagos. His third novel, Arrow of God, about an Igbo priest and a British district officer in 1920s Igboland, can be read as representative of the times of Okonkwo&#x2019;s son. All three novels, taken together as Achebe&#x2019;s &#x2018;African Trilogy&#x2019;, create a full and beautifully nuanced arc, a human chronicle of the cultural and political changes that brought about what is now seen as the modern African state. <br> <br>After William Heinemann overcame their reservations and published <i>Things Fall Apart</i> in June 1958, it became a critical success. Achebe, the <i>Times Literary Supplement</i> wrote, had &#x2018;genuinely succeeded in presenting tribal life from the inside.&#x2019; A novelty indeed. Things Fall Apart was pioneering not in its subject but in its African point of view, as there were already many well-regarded books about Africans written by non-Africans; tribal life had already been endlessly portrayed from the outside. Achebe himself first read some of the better-known examples of these &#x2018;colonialism classics&#x2019; as a secondary-school student in the 1940s. &#x2018;I did not see myself as an African to begin with,&#x2019; he has written about his response to the African characters. &#x2018;I took sides with the white men against the savages. The white man was good and reasonable and intelligent and courageous. The savages arrayed against him were sinister and stupid or, at the most, cunning. I hated their guts.&#x2019; As Achebe matured and became more critical in his reading, he began to understand the enormous power that stories had, and how much this power was shaped by who told the stories and by how they were told. As a university student in the 1950s, in addition to reading Wordsworth, Shakespeare and Coleridge, Achebe also read Joyce Cary&#x2019;s Mister Johnson, a novel set in Nigeria, which Time magazine had named the &#x2018;best book ever written about Africa.&#x2019; Achebe disagreed. Not only was the Nigerian character in the novel unrecognizable to him and his classmates but he also detected, in the description of Nigerians, &#x2018;an undertow of uncharitableness . . . a contagion of distaste, hatred and mockery.&#x2019; <br> <br>There has been much written about Chinua Achebe&#x2019;s <i>Things Fall Apart</i> as a response to Mister Johnson, and one likes to think that Achebe would have written his novel even if he had not read Cary&#x2019;s. Still, the prejudiced representation of African characters in literature could not but have had an influence on Achebe&#x2019;s development as a writer. He would, years later, write a famous essay about the portrayal of Africans in Joseph Conrad&#x2019;s classic novel <i>Heart of Darkness</i>, arguing that while Conrad had written honestly about the racism of the time, he had failed to hold an authorial rejection of that world-view. The strangeness of seeing oneself distorted in literature &#x2013; and indeed of not seeing oneself at all &#x2013; was part of my own childhood. I grew up in the Nigerian university town of Nsukka in the 1980s, reading a lot of British children&#x2019;s books. My early writing mimicked the books I was reading: all my characters were white and all my stories were set in England. Then I read <i>Things Fall Apart</i>. It was a glorious shock of discovery, as was <i>Arrow of God</i>, which I read shortly afterwards; I did not know in a concrete way until then that people like me could exist in literature. Here was a book that was unapologetically African, that was achingly familiar, but that was, also, exotic because it detailed the life of my people a hundred years before. Because I was educated in a Nigerian system that taught me little of my pre-colonial past, because I could not, for example, imagine with any accuracy how life had been organized in my part of the world in 1890, Achebe&#x2019;s novels became strangely personal. <i>Things Fall Apart</i> was no longer a novel about a man whose exaggerated masculinity and encompassing fear of weakness make it impossible for him to adapt to the changes in his society, it became the life my great-grandfather might have lived. <i>Arrow of God</i> was no longer just about the British administration&#x2019;s creation of warrant chiefs, and the linked destinies of two men &#x2013; one an Igbo priest, the other a British administrator; it became the story of my ancestral hometown during my grandfather&#x2019;s time. And <i>No Longer at Ease</i> transcended the story of an educated young Nigerian struggling with the pressure of new urban expectations in Lagos, and became the story of my father&#x2019;s generation.</p><h2>READING-LITERATURE Third Reader (Yesterday&#39;s Classics)</h2><p>Fourth volume in the series of Reading-Literature readers, whose purpose is to train children in reading and appreciating literature through the reading of literature. The Third Reader, while continuing with folk and fairy stories, introduces the wonder tale, which becomes the dominant note, while the fable gives place to more extended and more modern animal stories. The poetry begins with the group from Stevenson, whom the children have already learned to enjoy. Then follow selections from Lydia Maria Child, Lucy Larcom, Eugene Field, and a score of others dealing mainly with children&#39;s interests in animals and other forms of nature. With this series of books, besides merely learning to read, the child has the joy of reading the best in the language, and he is forming his taste for all subsequent reading. Attractive black and white illustrations are appealing to children. Suitable for ages 8 and up.</p><p></p><h2>Childhood Interrupted: The Complete Guide to PANDAS and PANS</h2><p>A host of behaviors&#x2014;OCD, Tourette&#x2019;s, anxiety, depression, tics, eating disorders, hair pulling, bedwetting, mood swings&#x2014;are often symptoms of an undiagnosed infection.

The continent seemed to offer a God-given opportunity to start again and build the perfect community. Those messianic days are gone. But as Alex Krieger argues in <i>City on a Hill,</i> any attempt at deep understanding of how the country has developed must recognize the persistent and dramatic consequences of utopian dreaming. Even as ideals have changed, idealism itself has for better and worse shaped our world of bricks and mortar, macadam, parks, and farmland. As he traces this uniquely American story from the Pilgrims to the &#x201c;smart city,&#x201d; Krieger delivers a striking new history of our built environment.</p><p>The Puritans were the first utopians, seeking a New Jerusalem in the New England villages that still stand as models of small-town life. In the Age of Revolution, Thomas Jefferson dreamed of citizen farmers tending plots laid out across the continent in a grid of enlightened rationality. As industrialization brought urbanization, reformers answered emerging slums with a zealous crusade of grand civic architecture and designed the vast urban parks vital to so many cities today. The twentieth century brought cycles of suburban dreaming and urban renewal&#x2015;one generation&#x2019;s utopia forming the next one&#x2019;s nightmare&#x2015;and experiments as diverse as Walt Disney&#x2019;s EPCOT, hippie communes, and Las Vegas.</p><p>Krieger&#x2019;s compelling and richly illustrated narrative reminds us, as we formulate new ideals today, that we chase our visions surrounded by the glories and failures of dreams gone by.</p></p><p>Alex Krieger is Professor in Practice of Urban Design at the Harvard Graduate School of Design, where he has been honored repeatedly as one of Harvard&#x2019;s most outstanding teachers.

He has written not just a history of American urbanism but a history of our attitudes toward cities, reminding us how profoundly our cities, for all their failings, reflect our aspirations. It is a story he tells with such richness and nuance that this book becomes, for all intents and purposes, a history of America itself.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Paul Goldberger, architecture critic and author of <i>Ballpark: Baseball in the American City</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Panoramic, original, and insightful, <i>City on a Hill</i> is a genuine achievement, and reflects and embodies Krieger&#x2019;s decades-long involvement both with urban design and American urban history.

Puar&#x2019;s pathbreaking <i>Terrorist Assemblages</i> remains one of the most influential queer theory texts and continues to reverberate across multiple political landscapes, activist projects, and scholarly pursuits. Puar argues that configurations of sexuality, race, gender, nation, class, and ethnicity are realigning in relation to contemporary forces of securitization, counterterrorism, and nationalism. She examines how liberal politics incorporate certain queer subjects into the fold of the nation-state, shifting queers from their construction as figures of death to subjects tied to ideas of life and productivity. This tenuous inclusion of some queer subjects depends, however, on the production of populations of Orientalized terrorist bodies. Heteronormative ideologies that the U.S. nation-state has long relied on are now accompanied by what Puar calls homonationalism&#x2014;a fusing of homosexuality to U.S. pro-war, pro-imperialist agendas.&nbsp;<br><br> As a concept and tool of biopolitical management, homonationalism is here to stay. Puar&#x2019;s incisive analyses of feminist and queer responses to the Abu Ghraib photographs, the decriminalization of sodomy in the wake of the Patriot Act, and the profiling of Sikh Americans and South Asian diasporic queers are not instances of a particular historical moment; rather, they are reflective of the dynamics saturating power, sexuality, race, and politics today.&nbsp;<br><br> This Tenth Anniversary Expanded Edition features a new foreword by Tavia Nyong&#x2019;o and a postscript by Puar entitled &#x201c;Homonationalism in Trump Times.&#x201d; Nyong&#x2019;o and Puar recontextualize the book in light of the current political moment while reposing its original questions to illuminate how Puar&#x2019;s interventions are even more vital and necessary than ever.</p><p>&#34;In this powerful book, Jasbir K. Puar offers a stunning critique of &#39;homonational&#39; politics. She rethinks intersections as assemblages, as networks of affect, intensity, and movement. The very rigor of her critique suggests an unflinching optimism about what is possible for queer politics.&#34;--Sara Ahmed, author of &#34;Queer Phenomenology: Orientations, Objects, Others&#34;Jasbir K.

An instructional introduction to drawing people, the book completely demystifies the whole process, showing how to build up great pictures using simple shapes and step-by-step illustrations. Words are not needed, as artists will be able to follow the sequences without any difficulty. Two colours are used effectively in a helpful way in each of the sequences and the superb collection of twenty eight drawings offers a range of different ages, ethnicities and poses. People at home, at work and at play are included, and using the building blocks in this book, beginners will soon find themselves producing fantastic finished drawings. More experienced artists interested in drawing figures will also find inspiration amongst the demonstrations on every page.</p><p>Susie Hodge has a passion for art education and has been teaching practical art and art history to children and adults for over 11 years. She has written and illustrated many books including "Art Attack" How to Draw, Drawing... is Fun! and many titles in the Art in History series. She also works for the Royal Academy, the Tate and the V&amp;A museum to produce booklets for visitors, teachers and students. She lives in Westcliff-on-Sea, Essex.Dec 13 Susie Hodge shows us how to draw people in this new addition to the How to Draw series. These books really do break it down to the absolute basics. Text features on just one of the 32 pages. Apart from this introduction, the drawings do all the talking. Six stages per page take you from a simple stick outline to the finished coloured drawing, featuring children, men and women of all ages in various poses - walking, dancing, sitting, playing sport, skipping and knitting. It may be simple instruction, but complete beginners can get great results. * Leisure Painter, The * Aug 13 I always said I wasn&#39;t going to review this series because it has no words, so you&#39;re really left with not a lot to talk about. However, I caved in when it got to Insects because, if a series gets that esoteric, it pretty much has to be popular. I mean, not only was it the only book on that subject (exclusively) I&#39;ve seen, but it&#39;s not exactly first-choice, is it? So here we have people. They must have done that one before, surely? Or was is a morning-after editorial meeting? &#34; No, we&#39;ve got to do the insects first.&#34; &#34;Have you been watching Dr Who again?&#34; &#34;Yes, MALCOLM TUCKER!!!&#34;* (Sorry, but I really am excited about this). For those of you who don&#39;t know, the stock-in-trade of this series is a single page which starts off with the simplest outlines, then builds up a basic shape and works it, in six steps, into a finished drawing. For a subject as complex as the human figure, that does mean there&#39;s an awful lot left out and some pretty giant leaps of the imagination, but it does work surprisingly well. If your main problem is getting started, then this is definitely the book for you and Susie does a fantastic job of choosing exactly which stages to illustrate so that you do get a genuine feeling of progression rather than giant steps. The only fly in the ointment is that I wish each demonstration had stopped at the fifth stage, the finished drawing, because these are in every case beautiful and sensitive works in pencil that need no further embellishment. The series, however, demands a colour finale and this is done by adding (what I think is) a completely unnecessary wash that covers the pencil lines and makes the whole thing, in almost all cases, look heavy and clumsy. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a problem with Susie&#39;s work with a wash, I just think it doesn&#39;t work with what&#39;s gone before. A couple of examples. There&#39;s a woman sitting knitting. Perfectly fine in the drawing, but the colour wash leaves a chair she&#39;ll fall off if she moves and which doesn&#39;t look strong enough to support its own weight, let alone hers. And the man with the stick. I&#39;m sorry, but that thing is two inches in diameter, it&#39;s nearly as thick as his arm! This is a quibble, but I do think it&#39;s best to ignore stage six and just stop at five. Treat this as what it claims to be, a book about drawing and put your paint box away. You get a fantastic variety of figures and poses, both static and in motion and a stripped-down approach that simply dissolves so much of the mystique that always surrounds figure drawing. * Peter Capaldi, Malcolm Tucker in The Thick Of It, was announced as the new Dr Who yesterday. * Artbookreview.net *</p><h2>Organize Your Mind, Organize Your Life: Train Your Brain to Get More Done in Less Time</h2><p><br><br>The key to a less hectic, less stressful life is not in simply organizing your desk, but organizing your mind.

They span the age and occupation spectrum&#x2014;elementary-school children, grandparents, lawyers, salesmen, housewives and house-husbands&#x2014;but they have one thing in common: they are coming to see me and my colleagues with familiar complaints and concerns. "I know I could be doing better" is a common one; as is, "I can't go on like this."<br><br>While the complaints may vary slightly, the symptoms they describe are the same&#x2014;and consistent with the condition we treat. You've probably heard of it: attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).<br><br>One of those patients, we'll call her Jill, is late for her appointment.<br><br>As I sit catching up on e-mails, the door bursts open and in she flies, out of breath from climbing the two flights of stairs to my second-floor office. She is flustered and clearly upset.<br><br>"Sorry I'm late!" Jill says, as she plops down on the chair facing my desk. "You wouldn't believe my day."<br><br>"Try me," I say. "Take a deep breath and tell me what's going on."<br><br>Jill is in her late thirties and a highly educated research scientist, one of the many "knowledge workers" who labor in Cambridge, home of Harvard and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She takes a moment and launches into her story, which begins a few weeks earlier when she temporarily moved into a friend's apartment while her own house was being renovated.<br><br>"Last night, when I came in," she says, "I put my keys down somewhere, and this morning, I had not a clue where they could be."<br><br>I nod. I have a feeling I know where this is going.<br><br>"I looked everywhere&#x2014;the usual places, which of course are not the usual places, as it's not my place. My friend, she really is a good friend, but I am wondering if she has more trouble than I do. You think I am disorganized, you should see her place..."<br><br>I know this is the right time to jump in and direct our conversation back to the issue at hand or&#x2014;like this morning&#x2014;Jill could continue running in verbal circles and not getting anywhere. "Okay, so, you were looking for your keys ...?" Jill smiles. "Oh, right, yes, I was flipping out. I spent thirty minutes trying to find my car keys."<br><br>Jill then stops, shaking her head.<br><br>"Well, did you find them?" I ask.<br><br>She nods ruefully. "Eventually."<br><br>"Where were they?"<br><br>"Right on my friend's kitchen table! And, of course, I'd walked back and forth through the kitchen ten times while I was looking for them. All that time they were right there...right there in front of me. Unbelievable!"<br><br>"Sounds very frustrating...but pretty believable, as those keys have eluded you before." Jill smiles ruefully, and I press on. "Then what happened?"<br><br>"My day was in shambles from that point on." Jill went on to relate how the half hour she'd spent looking for the keys set off a domino effect of tardiness and inefficiency&#x2014;problems galore. She arrived at work late for a meeting and opened the door to the conference room just in time to interrupt an important point that one of her company's head honchos was making. Embarrassed and angry at herself, she returned from the meeting and finally got in front of her computer to find a barrage of e-mail reminders that further annoyed and overwhelmed her. She sent out a flurry of responses, including a snippy reply to the wrong person, who was not happy to get it (neither was the correct recipient, when she eventually cleared up the mistake). Dealing with her e-mail gaffe kept her from attending to a project due by noon. Her deadline blown, she skipped lunch, scrambling to get her work done, and what she did hand in&#x2014;two hours late&#x2014;was subpar and received with something less than an enthusiastic response by her supervisor.<br><br>In other words, it was a crummy day for Jill. It wasn't the first time such a day had begun with something misplaced or by an episode of forgetfulness, but the snowball effect of losing her keys still surprised and upset her.<br><br>"This happens all the time," Jill says, teary-eyed, angry and ashamed. "At this rate, I could lose my job ...just because I can't keep track of stupid things like keys."<br><br> I'm sorry to hear that Jill is upset, but her story is not unusual. Jill has ADHD&#x2014;and she is certainly not alone. It's estimated that about 4 percent of adults and 5&#x2014;7 percent of children in this country meet the medical criteria for ADHD. It's equally safe to estimate that at some point in their lives almost everyone has <em>felt</em> as if they have ADHD, too. The symptoms of ADHD include forgetfulness, impulsiveness, losing items, making careless errors, being easily distracted and lacking focus. Who hasn't exhibited one of these symptoms in the last few days ...or even hours? Who hasn't lost their car keys? Who hasn't been distracted in the car (once the keys are located), on the job or at home&#x2014;by a text, a tweet, an e-mail, a cell phone ring? Who hasn't been late for a meeting or missed a deadline or made a mistake because they were disorganized that day, lost focus that morning or were distracted that minute? That doesn't necessarily mean you have ADHD, but it does suggest you might be part of the distracted masses that now make up such a large part of our society. If so, you've come to the right place because we're going to show you how to get back on track.<br><br>Whether or not you have ADHD&#x2014;and chances are, you probably don't&#x2014;the purpose of this book is to inform, inspire and organize your brain. Whether forgetfulness is a "symptom" of a disorder for a person like Jill or an "issue" for someone else who doesn't have the same degree of severity, this book will approach it in a straightforward way&#x2014;and with equally straightforward and effective solutions.<br><br>What was first labeled the "Distraction Epidemic" by <em>Slate</em> magazine in 2005 has now reached epic proportions, right up there with the obesity epidemic and is of no less import than that or other public health crises that have befallen modern society. In a 2009 <em>New York</em> magazine story on the attention crisis, David Meyer of the University of Michigan described it as nothing less than "a cognitive plague that has the potential to wipe out an entire generation of focused and productive thought" and has drawn comparisons to the insidious damage of nicotine addiction.<br><br>"People aren't aware of what's happening to their mental processes," says Meyer, "in the same way that people years ago couldn't look into their lungs and see the residual deposits." The difference here is that unlike the "mad men" of the 1950s and 1960s who went around merrily sucking up packs of unfiltered Camels, seemingly oblivious to the harmful effects, most of us today know that we are having problems staying focused, paying attention and maintaining some sense of order in our lives.<br><br>Unlike smoking (which you either do or don't do), it's not just the people afflicted by the most serious and definable form of distraction and disorganization&#x2014;ADHD&#x2014;who are affected by this epidemic. Ask friends, family members and colleagues how they're doing, and chances are, the responses will usually include words like "frazzled," "stressed," "overwhelmed" and "trying to keep my head above water." In casual conversation, you often hear people talking about "brain freezes," "blanking out" on something or suffering "senior moments" (often, when they really aren't very senior). All of them ...all of us ...are affected to some degree by the epidemic.<br><br>To get back to my patient Jill in the four-story brick building in Cambridge, Massachusetts, I knew that the woman with the lost keys and the lousy day was not one of the millions complaining to each other about how crazed their lives have become. She has a clinical disorder; most do not. But, as I listened to Jill's story, I also knew the potential power of a rather simple solution that could help her and many others.<br><br>A couple of weeks earlier, during one of our regular sessions, Jill and I had somehow gotten on to the topic of the Apollo lunar landing. We talked about the coverage of the fortieth anniversary of that historic moment, the spectacle of the great Saturn rocket that hurled the astronauts into space, how exciting it still was to see the old black-and-white images of Aldrin and Armstrong on the moon and hear their voices crackling over the television from Tranquility Base and about whether we'd ever go back.<br><br>The memory of that conversation about the space program and her interest in it gave me the language needed to help frame the solution for Jill.<br><br>"So, I have a thought about how to start your day tomorrow," I say. "As we've been talking about, we are working on bringing order into your life, changing old patterns that don't work with new ones that do."<br><br>"Right, that sounds good," she says attentively. "What's your idea?"<br><br>"You need a <em>launch pad</em> for your keys."<br><br>Her eyebrows raise quizzically.<br><br>"A launch pad," I repeat. "A place where you always put your keys and maybe your ID and glasses, too. That way, you'll know that's the place they're always going to be ...and every morning, that's where you'll launch your day."<br><br>Slowly, as if an unseen hand was drawing it methodically, a smile etches itself across her face.<br><br>"A launch pad," Jill says, starry-eyed "Yes, a launch pad. What do I have to use? A box...a hook...a basket...a tray?"<br><br>I smile back. "It's <em>your</em> launch pad. You can use whatever you like. You just need to make sure you know where it is and keep it in the same place ...so that the moment you enter your friend's house, you'll leave your keys there and then every morning that's where they'll be. On the launch pad, ready to lift off."<br><br>This seemed to really resonate with Jill. First of all, it was an actionoriented solution, something she could do right away and without great difficulty. But more importantly, and Jill appreciated this, the launch pad served as an image, a reminder of how one's day can begin, not in confusion and distraction but with precision and predictability.<br><br>The next week, Jill arrived for her appointment on time. And she entered the room not in a huff but with a smile.<br><br>"Go ahead," she says, "ask me about my forgetfulness this week. I'm ready to answer."<br><br>"Okay," I respond. "So tell me, did you forget any items, appointments, things like that this past week?"<br><br>"Nope," she said triumphantly, "and here's why." She reached into her pocketbook and pulled out a small, uncovered trinket box, one, she explained, that she hadn't used in years. "My launch pad," she says, proudly. "I have a spot for it right by the kitchen door." Moreover, Jill went on to tell me, she had not neglected the area around the launch pad. In fact, you could say that a major redevelopment project had been undertaken in the area: the table cleared and the space near the door rearranged so that her launch pad had its own ...well, <em>space.</em> That wasn't all, she reported. She built a launch pad at her office, too&#x2014;but this one was project oriented for critical tasks to distribute to others. This, too, was accompanied by a cleaning and rearranging of her workspace.<br><br>That week, you might say, all systems were go for Jill. Is this an ADHD "cure"? No, but it's a small success to build upon. And she has. You could see the impact on her organization and on her self-esteem; she began to regain confidence, as she could now trust herself that her mornings would be a little less frantic and a little more consistent. I'm happy to add that since she "launched" her launch pad, she has not missed a morning meeting again because of time spent looking for her keys.<br><br>My experience with Jill illustrates a few important points about organization. First, individual moments of forgetfulness and disorganization can have major consequences.<br><br></p><h2>Will Shortz Presents The Little Luxe Book of Sudoku: 335 Easy to Hard Puzzles</h2><p><p><b> Sudoku has never looked so good!</b> <br>With its stunning design,<i> Will Shortz Presents The Little Luxe Book of Sudoku </i>is bound to be the book every puzzle fan will want to be seen solving this season.<br>Edited by puzzlemaster Will Shortz, this beautiful book offers 345 easy-to-hard puzzles in a convenient portable size, perfect for carrying in your purse, briefcase, or backpack. </p><p>Features:<br>* 345 sudoku puzzles, arranged according to difficulty<br>* Sleek design with a covered spiral binding makes it easy to solve puzzles<br>* Durable hardcover protects the book as it travels with you wherever you go<br>* The perfect gift for any holiday<br>* Edited by Will Shortz.</p></p><p><p><b>Will Shortz</b> has been the crossword puzzle editor of <i>The New York Times</i> since 1993.

It traps a tenaciously living art in a theme park of the past. It cancels out the possibility that music in the spirit of Beethoven could still be created today. It banishes into limbo the work of thousands of active composers who have to explain to otherwise well-informed people what it is they do for a living. The phrase is a masterpiece of negative publicity, a tour de force of anti-hype. I wish there were another name. I envy jazz people who speak simply of "the music." Some jazz aficionados also call their art "America's classical music," and I propose a trade: they can have "classical," I'll take "the music."For at least a century, the music has been captive to a cult of mediocre elitism that tries to manufacture self-esteem by clutching at empty formulas of intellectual superiority. Consider other names in circulation: "art" music, "serious" music, "great" music, "good" music. Yes, the music can be great and serious, but greatness and seriousness are not its defining characteristics. It can also be stupid, vulgar, and insane. Composers are artists, not etiquette columnists; they have the right to express any emotion, any state of mind. They have been betrayed by well-meaning acolytes who believe that the music should be marketed as a luxury good, one that replaces an inferior popular product. These guardians say, in effect, "The music you love is trash. Listen instead to our great, arty music." They are making little headway with the unconverted because they have forgotten to define the music as something worth loving. Music is too personal a medium to support an absolute hierarchy of values. The best music is the music that persuades us that there is no other music in the world.When people hear "classical," they think "dead:" The music is described in terms of its distance from the present, its difference from the mass. No wonder that stories of its imminent demise are commonplace. Newspapers recite a familiar litany of problems: record companies are curtailing their classical divisions; orchestras are facing deficits; the music is barely taught in public schools, almost invisible in the media, ignored or mocked by Hollywood. Yet the same story was told forty, sixty, eighty years ago. <i>Stereo Review</i> wrote in 1969, "Fewer classical records are being sold because people are dying ... Today's dying classical market is what it is because fifteen years ago no one attempted to instill a love for classical music in the then impressionable children who have today become the market." The conductor Alfred Wallenstein wrote in 1950, "The economic crisis confronting the American symphony orchestra is becoming increasingly acute." The German critic Hans Heinz Stuckenschmidt wrote in 1926, "Concerts are poorly attended and budget deficits grow from year to year." Laments over the decline or death of the art appear as far back as the fourteenth century, when the sensuous melodies of Ars Nova were thought to signal the end of civilization. The pianist Charles Rosen has sagely observed, "The death of classical music is perhaps its oldest continuing tradition."The American classical audience is assumed to be a moribund crowd of the old, the white, the rich, and the bored. Statistics provided by the National Endowment for the Arts suggest that the situation is not quite so dire. Yes, the audience is older than that for any other art--the median age is forty-nine--but it is not the wealthiest. Musicals, plays, ballet, and museums all get larger slices of the $50,000-or-more income pie (as does the ESPN channel, for that matter). The parterre section at the Metropolitan Opera plays host to CEOs and socialites, but the less expensive parts of the house--as of this writing, most seats in the Family Circle go for twenty-five dollars--are well populated by schoolteachers, proofreaders, students, retirees, and others with no entry in the Social Register. If you want to see an in-your-face, Swiss-bank-account display of wealth, go look at the millionaires sitting in the skyboxes at a Billy Joel show, if security lets you. As for the graying of the audience, there is no denying the general trend, although with any luck it may begin to level off. Paradoxically, even as the audience ages, the performers keep getting younger. The musicians of the Berlin Philharmonic are, on average, a generation younger than the Rolling Stones.The music is always dying, ever-ending. It is like an ageless diva on a nonstop farewell tour, coming around for one absolutely final appearance. It is hard to name because it never really existed to begin with--not in the sense that it stemmed from a single time or place. It has no genealogy, no ethnicity: leading composers of today hail from China, Estonia, Argentina, Queens. The music is simply whatever composers create--a long string of written-down works to which various performing traditions have become attached. It encompasses the high, the low, empire, underground, dance, prayer, silence, noise. Composers are genius parasites; they feed voraciously on the song matter of their time in order to engender something new. They have gone through a rough stretch in the past hundred years, facing external obstacles (Hitler and Stalin were amateur music critics) as well as problems of their own invention ("Why doesn't anyone like our beautiful twelve-tone music?"). But they may be on the verge of an improbable renaissance, and the music may take a form that no one today would recognize.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>The critic Greg Sandow has written that the classical community needs to speak more from the heart about what the music means. He admits that it's easier to analyze his ardor than to express it. The music does not lend itself to the same kind of generational identification as, say, <i>Sgt. Pepper</i>. There may be kids out there who lost their virginity during Brahms's D-Minor Piano Concerto, but they don't want to tell the story and you don't want to hear it. The music attracts the reticent fraction of the population. It is an art of grand gestures and vast dimensions that plays to mobs of the quiet and the shy.I am a white American male who listened to nothing but classical music until the age of twenty. In retrospect, this seems bizarre; perhaps "freakish" is not too strong a word. Yet it felt natural at the time. I feel as though I grew up not during the seventies and eighties but during the thirties and forties, the decades of my parents' youth. Neither my mother nor my father had musical training--both worked as research mineralogists--but they were devoted concertgoers and record collectors. They came of age in the great American middlebrow era, when the music had a rather different place in the culture than it does today. In those years, in what now seems like a dream world, millions listened as Toscanini conducted the NBCSymphony on national radio. Walter Damrosch explained the classics to schoolchildren, singing ditties to help them remember the themes. (My mother remembers one of them: "This is / The sym-pho-nee / That Schubert wrote but never / Fi-nished ...") NBC would broadcast Ohio State vs. Indiana one afternoon, a recital by Lotte Lehmann the next. In my house, it was the Boston Symphony followed by the Washington Redskins. I was unaware of a yawning gap between the two.Early on, I delved into my parents' record collection, which was well stocked with artifacts of the golden age: Serge Koussevitzky's Sibelius, Charles Munch's Berlioz, the Thibaud-Casals-Cortot trio, the Budapest Quartet. The look and feel of the records were inseparable from the sound they made. There was Otto Klemperer's Zeppelin-like, slow-motion account of the St. <i>Matthew Passion</i>, with nightmare-spawning art by the Master of Delft. Toscanini's fierce renditions of Beethoven and Brahms were decorated with Robert Hupka's snapshots of the Maestro in motion, his face registering every emotion between ecstasy and disgust. Mozart's Divertimento in E-flat featured the famous portrait in which the composer looks down in sorrow, like a general surveying a hopeless battle. While listening, I read along in the liner notes, which were generally written in the over-the-top everyman-orator style that the media favored in the mid-twentieth century. Tchaikovsky, for example, was said to exhibit "melancholy, sometimes progressing to abysmal depths." None of this made sense at the time; I had no acquaintance with melancholy, let alone abysmal depths. What mattered was the exaggerated swoop of the thought, which matched my response to the music.The first work that I loved to the point of distraction was Beethoven's <i>Eroica</i> Symphony. At a garage sale my mother found a disc of Leonard Bernstein conducting the New York Philharmonic--one of a series of Music-Appreciation Records put out by the Book-of-the-Month Club. A companion record provided Bernstein's analysis of the symphony, a road map to its forty-five-minute sprawl. I now had names for the shapes that I perceived. (The conductor's <i>Joy of Music and Infinite Variety of Music</i> remain the best introductory books of their kind.) Bernstein drew attention to something that happens about ten seconds in: the fanfarelike main theme, in the key of E-flat, is waylaid by the note C-sharp. "There has been a stab of intrusive otherness," Bernstein said, cryptically but seductively, in his nicotine baritone. Over and over, I listened to this note of otherness. I bought a scoreand deciphered the notation. I learned some time-beating gestures from Max Rudolf's conducting manual. I held my family hostage in the living room as I led the record player in a searing performance of the <i>Eroica.</i>Did Lenny get a little carried away when he called that soft C-sharp in the cellos a "sho...</p><h2>Show Me a Story: 40 Craft Projects and Activities to Spark Children&#39;s Storytelling</h2><p><p>Encouraging children to let their imagination run wild, Emily K.

In&nbsp;<i>TechGnosis</i>&#x2014;a cult classic now updated and reissued with a new afterword&#x2014;Erik Davis argues that while the realms of the digital and the spiritual may seem worlds apart, esoteric and religious impulses have in fact always permeated (and sometimes inspired) technological communication. Davis uncovers startling connections between such seemingly disparate topics as electricity and alchemy; online roleplaying games and religious and occult practices; virtual reality and gnostic mythology; programming languages and Kabbalah. The final chapters address the apocalyptic dreams that haunt technology, providing vital historical context as well as new ways to think about a future defined by the mutant intermingling of mind and machine, nightmare and fantasy.</p><p>The gap between the technological mentality and the mystical outlook may not be as great as it seems. Erik Davis looks at modern information technology--and much previous technology--to reveal how much of it has roots in spiritual attitudes. Furthermore, he explores how those who embrace each new technological advance often do so with designs and expectations stemming from religious sensibilities. In doing so, Davis both compares and contrasts the scientific attitude that we can know reality technologically and the Gnostic idea of developing ultimate understanding. Although organized into reasonable chapters, there's a strong stream-of-consciousness component to Davis's writing. His expositions may run, for example, from information theory to the nebulous nature of Gnosticism to the philosophical problem of evil-�all in just a few pages. It's as if there are so many connections to make that Davis's prose has to run back and forth across time and space drawing the lines. But the result, rather than being chaotic, is a lively interplay of wide-ranging ideas. His style is equally lively and generally engaging--if sometimes straying into the hip. In the end, he succeeds in showing the spiritual side of what some may see as cold, technological thought. <i>--Elizabeth Lewis</i>Praise for TechGnosis<br><br>"TechGnosis is a tour de force of scholarship, insight, and juicy writing. Like McLuhan, Erik Davis sheds light on the shadows--the places we've neglected to look, or have feared to look, in our search for the meaning of human inventions."<br>--Howard Rheingold, author of The Virtual Community: Homesteading on the Electronic Frontier<br><br>"TechGnosis is at once an EEG of our silicon unconscious and a recovered memory of sacred technologies. Erudite but wired to the eyeballs, Davis is that rare blend: a postmodern classicist, equally at home with ancient automata and alien autopsies. A true believer in the politics of myth, he is mindful, nonetheless, of the social issues that haunt our techno-eschatologies. Erik Davis is the perfect tour guide to our Disneyland of the Gods."<br>--Mark Dery, author of Escape Velocity: Cyberculture at the End of the Century and editor of Flame Wars<br><br>"Erik Davis has written one of the best media studies books ever published. There's never been a more lucid analysis of the goofy, muddled, superstition-riddled human mind, struggling to come to terms with high technology. Unlike most tomes about tech, the occult, and social theory, TechGnosis is literate, accessible, and funny. A real winner all around!"<br>--Bruce Sterling, author of The Hacker Crackdown: Law and Disorder on the Electronic Frontier<br><br>"TechGnosis is a delirious and exhilarating exploration of the metascapes of new mind and new nature. Pungent and profound, the writing is pure alchemy, and the reader is redesigned in the very act of reading. This is perhaps the best book written on where we are going and how we got there."<br>--Jean Houston, author of A Mythic Life<br><br>"Erik Davis is an astute guide through the heavens and hells where cyber-reality, pop culture, and spiritual impulses arm wrestle each other for dominance. TechGnosis is a fascinating book that rewards the reader with an uncommon number of surprises and insights."<br>--Jay Kinney, editor-in-chief, Gnosis magazine<br><br>"Erik Davis's compendious recitation of the history of communications technology dominates the discursive landscape of techno-exegesis like a Martian war machine.

The first edition of SKYMATES became a cult classic; this new one goes light years further.</p><p>Steven Forrest is a professional astrologer and public speaker whose astrological bestsellers include The Inner Sky and Yesterday&#x2019;s Sky. His astrological apprenticeship program reaches students from around the world. Visit his website: www.forrestastrology.com.SKYMATES: Love, Sex, and Evolutionary Astrology, Volume One <p>Preface to the New Edition This new edition of Skymates is based on the previous edition in about the same way a Boeing 777 is based on the contraption the Wright brothers flew. Even if you have a dog-eared copy of the older book, we encourage you to open this one at random and take a look. You'll see the differences right away. </p><p> Our previous Skymates came out toward the end of the last century, in 1989, as a Bantam Books original, and the identical text was reprinted in 1992 under a new cover by ACS Publications. </p><p> Saying &#x201c;toward the end of the last century&#x201d; may seem precious here in the summer of 2001, but it feels right. When we wrote that book, we had been married only four or five years&#x2014;whistling past the graveyard, we joked a lot about tempting the Fates by writing a book about marriage so early in our own journey together. Now we're twenty years down the road, still loving each other one day at a time. We've learned a thing or two, and we've incorporated all of that into these pages. That's one big difference. </p><p> Another difference is that we're both in bed with our publishers nowadays. Seven Paws Press is our own business. That gives us a lot of freedom to write in our own voices, independent of the pervasive pressure on astrological writers to dumb everything down. We're still stinging from a conversation with an editor who insisted that &#x201c;enhanced&#x201d; was too hard a word for the astrological audience. We know that you, our readers, are smarter than that. On the other hand, perhaps we should be thankful to that editor&#x2014;Seven Paws Press owes a lot of its direction and intent to that exchange. </p><p> There are also many concrete differences between this new book and the previous one. The most obvious distinction is that we've added extensive &#x201c;cookbook&#x201d; sections. Learning to think astrologically is really the higher ground, but many readers have expressed appreciation for simply being able to look things up. If your natal Sun squares your partner's Venus, turn to Chapter Thirteen. If you are wondering about the sexual significance of Saturn being in your eighth house, try Chapter Eleven. </p><p> We've come to particularly &#x201c;enhanced&#x201d; understandings of the intimate meanings of two of astrology's core symbols: the fourth and sixth houses. We've added those perspectives to our previous &#x201c;arc of intimacy&#x201d; material&#x2014;and supplemented that entire section of the book with detailed analyses of what it means to have each particular planet in houses four, five, six, seven or eight. Name the configuration: it's there. </p><p> Back in our Bantam Books days, we were discouraged from making our writing &#x201c;too spiritual.&#x201d; That led to a diminished focus on the evolution of consciousness, and specifically on the psychological dynamics of reincarnation. We've filled that vacuum here&#x2014;although if you are uncomfortable with the idea of reincarnation, we think you will still find the book mostly accessible. Some of our assumptions are unabashedly metaphysical, but we try to speak the verifiable language of experience, and also of psychology. You can, in all cases, try on what we say and see if it works for you. </p><p> Finally, to make room for the extra content, something had to go. We decided to excise all the material about the composite chart which made up Part Four, &#x201c;The Eternal Triangle,&#x201d; of the original Skymates. That was a hard choice, but it was made even more pressing by the fact that we have learned enough about the composite chart over the last fourteen years to fill another book. </p><p> Writing that one is our next project. We hope to have Skymates, Volume Two: The Composite Chart, available sometime in 2003. </p><p> Jodie and Steven Forrest Borrego Springs, California July 21, 2001</p></p><h2>My Mama Says There Aren&#39;t Any Zombies, Ghosts, Vampires, Creatures, Demons, Monsters, Fiends, Goblins, or Things</h2><p>How can Nick believe his mother's telling him there aren't any monsters when she forgets what his favorite flavor of ice cream is?

Through detailed readings of over 100 films set in suburbs, small towns, on the road, in the desert, borderlands and the vast, empty West, the author investigates the alienation expressed by film noir, pinpointing its motivation in the conflict between desires for escape, autonomy and freedom--and fears of loneliness, exile and dissolution. Through such films as Out of the Past, They Live by Night and A Touch of Evil, this critical study examines how film noir reflected radical changes in the physical and social landscapes of postwar America, defining the genre&#39;s contribution to the eternal debate between the values of individualism and community.</p><p>Imogen Sara Smith has written on topics ranging from photography and painting to the films of Buster Keaton.

It wasn&#x2019;t until I was very close that I realized it was Lucy's. To begin with, I thought the splash of yellow against the white of my pillow was a discarded sock, a balled-up handkerchief perhaps. It was only when I drew nearer and saw the delicate crest of feathers, the tiny, silent beak, that I fully understood. And suddenly I understood so much more: everything in that moment became absolutely clear.</p><p>&#x201c;Hannah?&#x201d; I whispered. A floorboard creaked in the hall beyond my bedroom door. My scalp tightened. &#x201c;Hannah&#x201d;&#x2014;a little louder now, yet with the same fearful tremor in my voice&#x2014;&#x201c;is that you?&#x201d; No answer, but I felt her there, somewhere near; could feel her waiting, listening.</p><p>I didn&#x2019;t want to touch my little bird&#x2019;s head, could hardly bear to look at the thin brown line of congealed blood where it had been sliced clean from the body, or at the half-open, staring eyes. I wondered if she&#x2019;d been alive or dead when it happened, and started to feel sick.</p><p>When I went to Hannah&#x2019;s bedroom, she was standing by her window, looking down at the garden below. I said her name and she turned and regarded me, her beautiful dark eyes somber, just a trace of a smile on her lips. &#x201c;Yes, Mummy?&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong?&#x201d;</p><p></p><br><p></p><p>Two</p><p>London, 2017</p><p>Clara woke to the sound of rain, a distant siren wailing somewhere along Old Street, and the low, steady thump of bass from her neighbor&#x2019;s speakers. She knew instantly that Luke wasn&#x2019;t home&#x2014;not just absent from their bed but from the flat itself&#x2014;and for a moment she lay staring into the darkness before reaching for her phone. Four twelve a.m. No missed calls, no text messages. Through the gaps of her curtains, she could see the falling rain caught in a streetlamp&#x2019;s orange glare. From below her window on Hoxton Square came the sudden sharp peal of female laughter, followed by the clattering stumble of high heels.</p><p>Another hour passed before she finally gave up on sleep. Beyond their bedroom door, the first blue light had begun to seep into the flat&#x2019;s dark corners, the furniture gradually taking shape around her, its colors and edges looming like ships out of the darkness. The square&#x2019;s bars and clubs were silent now, the last stragglers long gone. Soon the sweep and trundle of the street cleaners&#x2019; truck would come to wash the night away; people would emerge from their buildings, heading for buses and trains; the day would begin.</p><p>Above her, the repetitive beat continued to pound, and sitting on the sofa wrapped in her duvet now, she stared down at her phone, her tired mind flicking through various explanations. They hadn&#x2019;t had a chance to speak yesterday at work, and she&#x2019;d left without asking him his plans. Later, she&#x2019;d met a friend for drinks before going to bed early, assuming he&#x2019;d be back before too long. Should she call him now? She hesitated. They&#x2019;d moved in together only six months before, and she didn&#x2019;t want to be that girlfriend&#x2014;nagging and needy, issuing demands and curfews. It was not the way things worked between them. He was out having fun. No big deal. It had happened before, after all&#x2014;a few drinks that had turned into a few more, then sleeping it off on someone&#x2019;s sofa.</p><p>Yet it was strange, wasn&#x2019;t it? To not even text&#x2014;to just not come home at all?</p><p>It wasn&#x2019;t until she was in the shower that she remembered the importance of the day&#x2019;s date. Wednesday the twenty-sixth. Luke&#x2019;s interview. The realization made her stand stock-still, the shampoo bottle poised in midair. Today was the big interview for his promotion at work. He&#x2019;d been preparing for it for weeks; there was no way he would stay out all night before something so important. Quickly she turned the water off and, wrapping herself in a towel, went back to the living room to find her phone. Clicking on his number, she waited impatiently for the ringtone to kick in. And then she heard the buzzing vibration coming from beneath the sofa. Crouching, she saw it, lying on the dusty expanse of floor, forgotten and abandoned: Luke&#x2019;s mobile. &#x201c;Shit,&#x201d; she said out loud, and as though surprised, the pounding music above her head ended abruptly.</p><p>After a moment&#x2019;s thought she clicked open her e-mail, and sure enough, there it was, a message from Luke, sent last night at six twenty-three from his work address.</p><p>Hey darling, left my phone at home again. I&#x2019;m going to stay and work on stuff for the interview, probably be here till eight, then coming home&#x2014;want to have an early night for tomorrow. You&#x2019;re out with Zoe, aren&#x2019;t you?</p><p>See you when I do,</p><p>Lx</p><p>An hour later, as she made her way up Old Street, she told herself to get a grip. He&#x2019;d changed his mind, that was all. Decided to go for a pint with his team, then ended up carrying the night on. He couldn&#x2019;t let her know because he was phoneless&#x2014;nothing else to it. She would see him soon enough at work, hungover and sheepish, full of apologies. So why was her stomach twisting and turning like this? Beneath the April sky, gray and damp like old chewing gum, she walked the ugly thoroughfare that was already gnarled with traffic, with the brutal hulking buildings of the roundabout ahead and the wide pavements filled with commuters pressing on and on, clutching coffee, earbuds in, staring down at phones or else inward looking, unseeing, as they moved as one toward the white-tiled station entrance, to be sucked in, then hurtled forward, and spit out again at the other end.</p><p>The magazine publisher where they both worked was in the center of Soho. Though they were on separate magazines&#x2014;she a writer on a finance title, he heading the design desk of an architectural quarterly&#x2014;it was where they&#x2019;d met three years ago, shortly before they&#x2019;d started going out.</p><p>It had been her first day at Brindle Press and, eager to make a good impression, she&#x2019;d offered to make the first round of tea. Anxiously running through everyone&#x2019;s names as she&#x2019;d sloshed water onto tea bags and stirred in milk and sugar, she&#x2019;d piled too many mugs on the tray before she&#x2019;d hurried out of the kitchen. The mess when it slipped from her hands and came crashing to the floor had been spectacular: scattered shards of broken crockery, rivers of steaming brown liquid, her carefully chosen &#x201c;first day&#x201d; dress soaked through.</p><p>Fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck. It was only then that she&#x2019;d looked up and seen him, the tall, good-looking man standing in the doorway, watching her with amusement. &#x201c;Oops,&#x201d; he&#x2019;d said, crouching down to help her.</p><p>&#x201c;Christ, I&#x2019;m an idiot,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d wailed.</p><p>He&#x2019;d laughed. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry about it,&#x201d; he said, then added, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Luke.&#x201d;</p><p>That evening, when her new team had taken her out for welcome drinks, she had spotted him by the bar, her heart quickening as she met his gaze, his dark eyes holding her there, as though he&#x2019;d reached out his hand and touched her.</p><p>Now, as she approached her desk, the phone rang, its tone signaling an internal line, and she snatched it up eagerly. &#x201c;Luke?&#x201d;</p><p>But it was his deputy, Lauren. &#x201c;Clara? Where the fuck is he?&#x201d;</p><p>She felt herself flush. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d;</p><p>There was a short, surprised silence. &#x201c;Right. What, you don&#x2019;t&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. You haven&#x2019;t seen him this morning?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He didn&#x2019;t come home last night,&#x201d; she admitted.</p><p>Lauren digested this. &#x201c;Huh.&#x201d; And then Clara heard her say loudly to whoever was listening nearby, &#x201c;He didn&#x2019;t come home last night!&#x201d; A chorus of male laughter, of leering comments she couldn&#x2019;t quite catch, though the tone was clear: Naughty Luke. They were joking, she knew, and their laughter was comforting, in a way, signifying their lack of concern. Still, she clutched the receiver tightly until Lauren came back on the line. &#x201c;Well, not to worry. Fucker&#x2019;s probably dead in a ditch somewhere,&#x201d; she said cheerfully. &#x201c;When you do speak to him, tell him Charlie&#x2019;s raging&#x2014;he&#x2019;s missed the cover meeting now. Later, yeah?&#x201d; And then she hung up.</p><p>Maybe she should go through his contacts list, ring around his friends. But what if he did arrive soon? He&#x2019;d be mortified she&#x2019;d made such a fuss. And surely he was bound to turn up sooner or later&#x2014;people always did, after all.</p><p>Suddenly his best friend, Joe McKenzie&#x2019;s, face flashed into Clara&#x2019;s mind, and for the first time, her spirits lifted a little. Mac. He&#x2019;d know what to do. She grabbed her mobile and hurried out into the corridor to call him, feeling immediately comforted when she heard his familiar Glaswegian accent.</p><p>&#x201c;Clara? How&#x2019;s it going?&#x201d;</p><p>She pictured Mac&#x2019;s pale, serious face, the small brown eyes that peered distractedly from beneath its mop of black hair.</p><p>&#x201c;Have you seen Luke?&#x201d; she asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Hang on.&#x201d; The White Stripes blared in the background while she waited impatiently, imagining him fighting his way through the chaos of his photographic studio before the noise was abruptly killed and Mac came back on the line. &#x201c;Luke? No. Why? What&#x2019;s&#x2014; Haven&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;</p><p>Quickly she explained, her words spilling out in a rush: Luke&#x2019;s forgotten mobile, his e-mail, his missed interview.</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; Mac said when she&#x2019;d finished. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s odd, right enough. He&#x2019;d never miss that interview.&#x201d; He thought for a moment. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll call around everyone. Ask if they&#x2019;ve seen him. He&#x2019;s probably been on a bender and overslept&#x2014;you know what he&#x2019;s like.&#x201d;</p><p>But his text half an hour later read, No one&#x2019;s heard from him. I&#x2019;ll keep trying though, I&#x2019;m sure he&#x2019;ll turn up.</p><p>She couldn&#x2019;t shake the feeling that something was very wrong. Despite his colleagues&#x2019; laughter, she didn&#x2019;t really think he&#x2019;d been with another woman. Even if he had, a one-night stand didn&#x2019;t take this long, surely. She made herself face the real reason for her anxiety: Luke&#x2019;s &#x201c;stalker.&#x201d;</p><p>Putting the word in inverted commas, treating it all as a bit of a joke, was something Luke had done ever since it had begun nearly a year ago. He&#x2019;d even christened whoever it was &#x201c;Barry&#x201d;&#x2014;a comical, harmless name to prove just how unthreatened he was by it all. &#x201c;Barry strikes again!&#x201d; he&#x2019;d say after yet another vicious Facebook message, or silent phone call, or unwelcome &#x201c;gift&#x201d; through the post.</p><p>But then things had gotten weirder. First an envelope stuffed with photographs had been pushed through their mail slot. Each one was of Luke and showed him doing the most mundane things&#x2014;queuing at a caf�, or walking to the tube, or getting into their car. Whoever had taken them had clearly been following him closely&#x2014;with a wide-angled lens, Mac had said. It had made Clara&#x2019;s skin crawl. The photos had been stuffed through their mail slot with arrogant nonchalance, as if to say, This is what I can do. Look how easy it is. But though she&#x2019;d been desperate to call the police, Luke wouldn&#x2019;t hear of it. It was as if he was determined to pretend it wasn&#x2019;t happening, that it was merely an annoyance that would soon go away. And no matter how much she begged, he wouldn&#x2019;t budge.</p><p>And then, three months ago, they&#x2019;d come home late from a party to find the door to their flat forced open. Clara would never forget the creepy chill she&#x2019;d felt as they silently walked around their home, knowing some stranger had recently been there&#x2014;going through their things, touching their belongings. But the strange thing was, everything had been left in perfect order: nothing had been stolen; nothing, as far as she could tell, had been moved. Only a handwritten message on a page torn from Clara&#x2019;s notepad had been sitting on the kitchen table: I&#x2019;ll be seeing you, Luke.</p><p>At least Luke had been sufficiently rattled to let Clara report that to the police. Who didn&#x2019;t even turn up until the next day and discovered precisely nothing&#x2014;the neighbors hadn&#x2019;t seen anything; no fingerprints had been found&#x2014;and as nothing had been taken or damaged, within days the so-called &#x201c;investigation&#x201d; had quietly fizzled out.</p><p>Stranger still, after that, it was as if whoever it was had lost interest. For weeks now there&#x2019;d been no new incidents, and Luke had been triumphant. &#x201c;See?&#x201d; he&#x2019;d said. &#x201c;Told you they&#x2019;d get bored eventually!&#x201d; But although Clara had tried hard to put it out of her mind, she hadn&#x2019;t quite been able to forget the menace of that note&#x2014;or the idea that the culprit was still out there somewhere, just biding his time.</p><p>And now Luke had disappeared. What if &#x201c;Barry&#x201d; had something to do with it? Even as she allowed the thought to form, she could hear Luke&#x2019;s laugh, see his eyes roll. &#x201c;Jesus, Clara, will you stop being so dramatic?&#x201d; But as the morning progressed, her sense of foreboding grew and when lunchtime came, instead of going to her usual caf�, she found herself walking back toward the tube.</p><p>She reached Hoxton Square half an hour later, and when she caught sight of her squat yellow-bricked building on its farthest corner, she was struck suddenly by the overwhelming certainty that Luke would be there waiting for her, and she ran the final few hundred yards&#x2014;past the restaurants and bars, the black railings and shadowy lawn of the central garden&#x2014;and out of breath by the time she reached the front door, she impatiently unlocked it before sprinting up the communal stairs to her flat. But when she got there, it was empty.</p><p>She sank into a chair, the flat too silent and still around her. On the coffee table in front of her was a photo she&#x2019;d had framed when they&#x2019;d first moved in together, and she picked it up now. It was of the two of them on Hampstead Heath three summers before, heads squashed together as they grinned into the camera, a scorching day in June. That first summer, the days seemed to roll out before them hot and limitless, London theirs for the taking. She had fallen in love almost instantly, as effortlessly as breathing, certain she had never met anyone like him before, this handsome, exuberant man so full of energy and sweetness and easy charm, who (inexplicably, it seemed to her) appeared to find her just as irresistible. As she gazed down at the photo now, their happiness trapped and unreachable behind glass, she traced his face with her finger. &#x201c;Where are you?&#x201d; she whispered. &#x201c;Where the bloody hell are you, Luke?&#x201d;</p><p>At that moment she heard the front door slam two floors below and her heart lurched. She listened, her breath held, as the footsteps on the stairs grew louder. When they paused outside her door, she sprang to her feet and rushed to open it, but with a jolt of surprise found it was her upstairs neighbor, and not Luke, staring back at her.</p><p>She didn&#x2019;t know the name of the woman who&#x2019;d lived above them for the past six months. She could, Clara thought, be anything between mid-twenties and mid-thirties; it was impossible to tell. She was very thin with long, lank brown hair, behind which could occasionally be glimpsed a small, finely featured face covered in a thick, masklike layer of makeup. In all the time Clara and Luke had lived there, she&#x2019;d never once replied to their greetings, merely shuffling past with downcast eyes whenever they met on the stairs. Every time either of them had gone up to ask her to turn her music down, which she played loudly night and day, she refused to answer the door, merely turning the volume up higher until they went away.</p><p>&#x201c;Can I help y&#x2014;,&#x201d; Clara began, but the woman had already begun heading toward the stairs. Clara wat...</p></p><h2>The Confessions of St. Augustine</h2><p><p><i>Confessions of St. Augustine</i> is--after the Bible and <i>The</i> <i>Imitation of Christ</i>--the most widely translated and highly esteemed book in Christian history.

Many of these breaker boys worked 10 hours a day, six days a week all for as little as 45 cents a day. Child labor was common in the United States in the 19th century. It took the compelling, heart breaking photographs of Lewis Hine and others to bring the harsh working conditions to light. Hine and his fellow Progressives wanted to end child labor. He knew photography would reveal the truth and teach and change the world. With his camera Hine showed people what life was like for immigrants, the poor, and the children working in mines, factories, and mills. In the words of an historian, the more than 7,000 photos Hine took of American children at work aroused public sentiment against child labor in a way that no printed page or public lecture could.</p><p>Formerly an editor at the educational publisher Weekly Reader, Michael Burgan has been a freelance writer for 17 years.

It was left to the embryonic National Socialist group to see in Feder's ideas the means of achieving both freedom from debt-bondage and the means by which the state could assume its prime duty to issue the community's own credit, limited only by its productivity and creativity.</p><p>Even though, as the Reich progressed, Feder, like many other early idealists, was relegated to minor rank within the Third Reich, his fundamental ideas provided the basis for Germany's socio-economic revival while the rest of the world wallowed in Depression. In this respect Feder is Germany's equivalent to New Zealand's John A. Lee, Australia's Jack Lang, U.S.A.'s Father Charles Coughlin, and Britain's C. H. Douglas and Arthur Kitson. Feder deserves an honoured place amongst the early fighters against usury-capital, a subject which continues to be, perhaps more than ever, of vital relevance to the world.</p></p><p></p><h2>Finding Tinker Bell #5: To the Forgotten Castle (Disney: The Never Girls)</h2><p><b>The <i>New York Times</i> bestselling Disney Never Girls series continues with a new adventure in which the Never Girls embark on a quest to find Tinker Bell!</b><br><br>When Tinker Bell sets out on a trip beyond Never Land and disappears, it's up to the Disney Never Girls--Kate, Mia, Lainey, and Gabby--to find their missing fairy friend.

The <i>Treasure</i>, the toy boat Tink was sailing, belonged to her family. Her great-grandfather had made it, and Gabby had promised Papi she would bring it home safe and sound. <br> But looking hard for something can play tricks on your mind. The longer Gabby searched for Tink, the more she thought that she saw her everywhere. Just that day, she&#x2019;d mistaken a goldfinch for the fairy&#x2019;s golden glow. A glimmer Gabby was sure was Tink had turned out to be a large dragonfly. And now the duck. <br> Fawn, the animal-talent fairy, shook her head. &#x201c;Sorry, Gabby, but how could you mistake a <i>duck</i> for Tinker Bell?&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;Well, Tink is in a boat,&#x201d; Gabby replied. &#x201c;And the duck was the same size as the boat. And its feathers were sort of greenish, and . . .&#x201d; She trailed off. They were all staring at her. <br> &#x201c;Um, they both float?&#x201d; she finished meekly. <br> &#x201c;Gabby,&#x201d; Mia said with a sigh, &#x201c;that&#x2019;s the third wild-goose chase today.&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you mean a wild-<i>duck</i> chase?&#x201d; Kate said with a smirk. <br> Mia rolled her eyes. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m serious. Gabby, you have to stop messing around. At this rate, we&#x2019;ll be going in circles on Shadow Island forever.&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;I wasn&#x2019;t messing around,&#x201d; Gabby muttered. <br> &#x201c;Just do us a favor,&#x201d; Mia said. &#x201c;Next time, don&#x2019;t yell &#x2018;Tinker Bell&#x2019; unless you&#x2019;re sure it&#x2019;s her.&#x201d; <br> Gabby pressed her lips tight together. She hated it when Mia talked down to her, especially in front of the fairies. Of course she wouldn&#x2019;t yell &#x201c;Tinker Bell&#x201d; unless she was sure! Or, at least, really and truly <i>almost </i>sure. Did they think she was making stuff up on <i>purpose</i>? <br> Gabby scowled at the reeds where the duck had been hiding. &#x201c;Dumb duck,&#x201d; she grumbled. <br> Silvermist, the water-talent fairy, eyed Gabby&#x2019;s soaked tutu. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve probably washed off your fairy dust. You&#x2019;ll need more to fly.&#x201d; <br> Silvermist didn&#x2019;t sound upset, but Gabby heard the gentle reprimand. She knew that they were trying to save fairy dust. The fairy dust allowed them all to fly, and it gave the fairies their magic. But they only had a small supply. They&#x2019;d already learned the hard way that they had to make it last. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay,&#x201d; she said quickly. &#x201c;I can walk.&#x201d; <br> Gabby glanced at the other fairies to make sure they&#x2019;d heard. But they weren&#x2019;t paying any attention. They were huddled over the map of Shadow Island. Their wings gently stirred the air as they studied it. <br> &#x201c;What I don&#x2019;t understand is where else she could be,&#x201d; Fawn said. &#x201c;This is the only river. I can&#x2019;t believe Tink is that far ahead of us.&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;Maybe there&#x2019;s a branch of the river that we missed,&#x201d; Rosetta, the garden-talent fairy, suggested. <br> Iridessa, the light-talent fairy, eyed the dark clouds gathering on the horizon. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m worried about those thunderheads. What we should be looking for is a place to get out of the rain,&#x201d; she said. <br> Gabby tried to look over the fairies&#x2019; shoulders at the map. But they glanced up, frowning. <br> &#x201c;Sweet girl, would you mind stepping back? You&#x2019;re casting a shadow,&#x201d; Rosetta said. <br> &#x201c;Sorry.&#x201d; Gabby moved away. <br> With nothing better to do, she sat down beside the stream. The water made a pretty sound as it ran over the rocks. Tiny fish darted in the shallows. <br> Gabby watched as a small dark shape flitted over the surface of the water. It disappeared into the reeds on the other side of the stream. <br> Gabby had seen it before. It looked like a small bird or a large moth. Whatever it was, it had been following them for a while. <br> &#x201c;There&#x2019;s that moth again,&#x201d; she announced to no one in particular. <br> No one gave any sign that they&#x2019;d heard her. <br> Gabby watched the reeds. A moment later, the moth appeared again a short distance away. <i>It has an odd shape</i>, Gabby thought. It was not really mothlike at all. In fact, it looked a little like a fairy. <br> She opened her mouth to say so, then thought better of it. &#x201c;Sure is a funnylooking moth, though.&#x201d; <br> Fawn finally glanced up from the map. &#x201c;Moth?&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;Never mind. It&#x2019;s gone.&#x201d; Gabby looked toward the trees where the moth had disappeared. Beyond the tree branches, she spied something she hadn&#x2019;t noticed before. <br> Gabby squinted at it. &#x201c;Hey,&#x201d; she said. <br> &#x201c;I think I saw a cave a little ways back,&#x201d; Kate was saying. &#x201c;We could wait out the storm there.&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;Hey, guys,&#x201d; Gabby said again. <br> &#x201c;Maybe we&#x2019;re better off stopping here for the night,&#x201d; Fawn said. &#x201c;We could find a tree to shelter under.&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;Or,&#x201d; Gabby said loudly, &#x201c;we could try that castle.&#x201d; <br> This time, they all looked up. <br> &#x201c;What castle?&#x201d; asked Kate. <br> &#x201c;There.&#x201d; Gabby pointed. Rising above the trees was a tall stone tower.</p><h2>Christopher Parkening Guitar Method Volume 2 Book/CD</h2><p>(Guitar Method).

Lopez Jr. explores the origins of this 2,500-year-old religion and traces its major developments up to the present, focusing not only on the essential elemenmts common to all schools of Buddhism but also revealing the differences among the major traditions. Beginning with the creation and structure of the Buddhist universe, Lopez explores the life of the Buddha, the core Buddhist tenets, and the development of the monastic life and lay practices. Combining brilliant scholarship with fascinating stories - contemporary and historical, sometimes miraculous, sometimes humorous - this rich and absorbing volume presents a fresh and expert history of Buddhism and Buddhist life.</p></p><p>Much of what we hear about Buddhism today in the West focuses on its philosophy, and how it can change one's life. Throughout history, however, Buddhism's mythology, scriptures, heroes, and its promise for salvation from rebirth have been the Buddhist teachings that most people have known. Religion professor Donald Lopez has mastered a good deal of this immense lore and managed with <i>The Story of Buddhism</i> to get it into a manageable package. Rather than providing a chronological history or country-by-country breakdown, Lopez explores general topics, meandering through two-and-a-half millennia, from India to Japan. In sections such as "Monastic Life," "Tantra," and "Pilgrimage," he talks about the origins of each topic and its mainstream manifestations. In addition, he spices up his work with delectable, if occasionally bizarre, examples from specific cultures. There is, for instance, the story of the depraved man who, once having said the words "Lotus Sutra," was saved from Hell. And the tale of the practice called the "act of truth," in which a perfectly candid statement can have magical powers. Or the story of the monk who attempted to rescue some maggots by opening his own flesh for them. No doubt, Buddhism is interesting, but it takes a competent scholar and a good storyteller to get it just right. Lopez fills the bill. <i>--Brian Bruya</i>Donald S. Lopez Jr. is the Carl W. Belser Professor of Buddhist and Tibetan Studies at the University of Michigan. He is the author and editor of many books on Buddhism, including <em>Buddhism in Practice</em> and <em>Prisoners of Shangri-La: Tibetan Buddhism and the West,</em> and key religious texts by His Holiness the Dalai Lama: <em>The Joy of Living and Dying in Peace, The Way to Freedom,</em> and <em>Awakening the Mind, Lightening the Heart.</em></p><h2>Clay A Studio Handbook</h2><p>Revision and update of 1st edition.</p><p>The author of <i>Clay A Studio Handbook</i> is Vince Pitelka, himself an established ceramics artist.

But the price for cattle is down, so I ain&#x2019;t gonna give you that bonus.&#x201d; He paused again to witness the looks of shock and disappointment, but unable to play the joke out any further, he cracked, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m just joshin&#x2019; ya. I got top dollar for the cattle, but you oughta see the look on your faces.&#x201d; The silence that had descended upon the drovers immediately erupted into a burst of cackling relief. &#x201c;Like I said, you can each pick one horse outta this bunch in the corral, too. Now, who&#x2019;s first?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;I reckon I am,&#x201d; Smoky Lewis volunteered, and stepped forward. The cook on the drive, Smoky owned his chuck wagon and the team of horses that pulled it. He had a separate arrangement with Oscar, since he had come along as an independent contractor to do the cooking. &#x201c;You might not really be japin&#x2019;, so I&#x2019;ll get my money before you run out.&#x201d; </p><p>His remark, made in jest, brought a few chuckles from the other men. Oscar Bradley was a fair man. Each of his drovers knew that he would lose money on the sale of the cattle before he would go back on his word to them. Their only regret was the fact that this was Oscar&#x2019;s last drive. </p><p>One by one, the men stepped up to receive their pay. Oscar marked each man&#x2019;s name off in his notebook with his pencil and shook the man&#x2019;s hand. He paused briefly when the Cross brothers stepped up. Billy, the younger, was first. He and his brother, Logan, had been working for Oscar since they were teenage boys, and they had proven to be his most dependable drovers. </p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry I don&#x2019;t have something else for you fellers, but like I told you, I&#x2019;m headin&#x2019; back to Omaha to sit in a rockin&#x2019; chair on my daughter&#x2019;s front porch. I know I&#x2019;d sure as hell give you a good recommendation, if anybody was to ask me.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Thanks, Oscar,&#x201d; Logan replied. </p><p>&#x201c;What are you plannin&#x2019; to do, go back to Ogallala with the rest of the boys?&#x201d; Oscar asked. </p><p>&#x201c;I reckon so,&#x201d; Logan said. &#x201c;We ain&#x2019;t talked about doin&#x2019; anything else.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Except gettin&#x2019; a drink of whiskey first thing,&#x201d; Billy piped up. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s about as long as I wanna stay around this place.&#x201d; </p><p>He and Logan had already decided that there was no future for them in Fort Pierre. It seemed the only sensible thing for them to do was to return to Ogallala with the others in hopes of signing on with another cattleman. Herding cattle was all they knew. </p><p>&#x201c;Hang around till I get everybody paid,&#x201d; Oscar said. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a little somethin&#x2019; I&#x2019;d like to run by you.&#x201d; </p><p>Billy glanced at his brother, and Logan responded with a shrug. &#x201c;Sure thing, Oscar,&#x201d; Logan said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m gonna go throw my saddle on that flea-bitten gray standin&#x2019; over by the fence before somebody else has the same idea.&#x201d; The gray had been his favorite and the one that he had most often ridden. It was the only one he had named, calling it Pepper. Having already set his sights on a buckskin, Billy followed him. </p><p>After every man had selected a horse and saddled it, Smoky Lewis motioned to Logan and said, &#x201c;We&#x2019;re goin&#x2019; over to the Cattleman&#x2019;s Saloon. You and Billy comin&#x2019;?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;You go ahead,&#x201d; Logan said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll be along.&#x201d; </p><p>When the others had gone, Oscar put his notebook away and picked up his leather bag. &#x201c;I was talkin&#x2019; to a feller at the cattle sale, and he said he was lookin&#x2019; to hire a couple of men to help him drive some horses over to Sturgis in the Black Hills. He&#x2019;s got two men who work for him, but he could use a couple more, since he wound up buyin&#x2019; more than he planned.&#x201d; Oscar smiled and winked. &#x201c;I sold him the rest of the horses here in the corral at such a good price he couldn&#x2019;t pass it up.&#x201d; He paused for their reaction before continuing. &#x201c;Anyway, I told him I knew two good men who might be interested. Whaddaya think? You wanna drive some horses over to the Black Hills? There&#x2019;s a helluva lot goin&#x2019; on up that way ever since the government opened the hills up for prospectors. This feller said there&#x2019;s a heap of travel on the roads between here and Sturgis&#x2014;mule trains, bull trains, wagons, and everything else that rolls or trots. Might be somethin&#x2019; else over that way for you boys.&#x201d; </p><p>As usual, Billy looked at his older brother for his reaction. &#x201c;How long a drive would it be?&#x201d; Logan asked. </p><p>&#x201c;He said it&#x2019;s about a hundred and fifty miles from here,&#x201d; Oscar said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;d take a week or more, I expect. I told him I&#x2019;d see if you were interested.&#x201d; </p><p>Again, looking to Logan for his opinion, Billy shrugged and joked, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t recollect any appointments we&#x2019;ve got. Whadda you think, Logan?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Wouldn&#x2019;t hurt to talk to the man,&#x201d; Logan replied. &#x201c;Where do we find him?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;He said he&#x2019;ll be in O&#x2019;Malley&#x2019;s place in about an hour from now. It&#x2019;s that little saloon down the street from the hotel. His name&#x2019;s Matt Morrison&#x2014;seems like a reasonable feller.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Okay, we&#x2019;ll go talk to him,&#x201d; Logan said. &#x201c;That all right with you?&#x201d; he asked Billy. When his brother shrugged indifferently, he turned back to Bradley. &#x201c;Much obliged, Oscar. We appreciate it.&#x201d; They shook hands again, and then he and Billy climbed into their saddles. </p><p>Oscar stood there and watched them as they rode off toward the town of Fort Pierre. <i>I wish I was as young as those two,</i> he thought. <i>I&#x2019;d ride to the Black Hills with them</i>. </p><p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p><p>Fort Pierre was settled on the west bank of the Missouri River, on a level plain that provided easy access to the river. It was a pleasant setting for a town, but it held no attraction for the Cross brothers. They rode past the Cattleman&#x2019;s Saloon, even though there was plenty of time to have a drink or two with the rest of Oscar&#x2019;s crew before Mr. Morrison was supposed to be at O&#x2019;Malley&#x2019;s. They both agreed that it might cause some resentment if the others found out that Oscar had favored them with his recommendation. </p><p>There were a few horses tied up in front of O&#x2019;Malley&#x2019;s, though not as many as those at the larger saloon&#x2019;s hitching rail. Dismounting, they pulled their rifles from the saddle slings and walked in the door. They paused to let their eyes adjust to the darkness of the room, a sharp contrast to the bright summer sunshine outside. After a moment, they started toward a table against the opposite wall, thinking it a good place to watch the door and spot Morrison when he walked in. </p><p>They had taken no more than a few steps when they were stopped by the bartender. &#x201c;Howdy, gents,&#x201d; he greeted them cordially. &#x201c;If you don&#x2019;t mind, I&#x2019;d appreciate it if you&#x2019;d leave those rifles on that table by the door.&#x201d; When both men balked for a second, he continued. &#x201c;I reckon you fellers ain&#x2019;t ever been in here before. We ask every customer to do the same.&#x201d; He smiled then to show he meant nothing personal. </p><p>Logan looked back toward the door. Like his brother, he hadn&#x2019;t noticed the table with half a dozen pistols on it. &#x201c;Sure,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;seems like a good idea.&#x201d; He and Billy went back and propped their rifles against the table and laid their pistols on top. Then they proceeded toward the table they had selected. </p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s your poison?&#x201d; Roy, the bartender, asked as they passed by the bar. </p><p>&#x201c;Whiskey,&#x201d; Billy answered. &#x201c;Just whatever you got&#x2014;rye, if I&#x2019;ve got a choice.&#x201d; Neither he nor Logan was a heavy drinker, so it really didn&#x2019;t matter. </p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got rye,&#x201d; Roy said. &#x201c;And I&#x2019;ve also got some smooth Kentucky bourbon, if you&#x2019;d rather have it.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Which is the cheapest?&#x201d; Logan asked. </p><p>&#x201c;Rye,&#x201d; Roy said. </p><p>&#x201c;Then we&#x2019;ll have that, and two glasses of beer to chase it,&#x201d; Logan said, and stopped to wait for it while Billy continued to the table. </p><p>&#x201c;Well, here&#x2019;s to another cattle drive behind us,&#x201d; Logan said after they were seated. He raised his shot glass in a toast. Billy raised his glass to meet it, and they tossed the fiery whiskey down. </p><p>&#x201c;Whew!&#x201d; Billy coughed. &#x201c;That stuff burns all the way down.&#x201d; </p><p>Logan laughed. &#x201c;It makes a difference when it&#x2019;s been a long time between drinks.&#x201d; </p><p>Working slowly on the beer, they looked around them at the sparse crowd in the saloon. Only three other tables were occupied. And of the three, only one had more than two men quietly enjoying an afternoon drink of whiskey. That table, back in a corner of the room, was occupied by three men and a woman. The two brothers had sat there for only a few minutes before the woman got up to take an empty bottle to the bar to exchange for a full one. </p><p>On her way past them, she openly eyed the two strangers, and on her way back, she favored Billy with a smile. It didn&#x2019;t surprise Logan. His younger brother had been blessed with the good looks of his mother, while Logan seemed to have inherited the brawn and strength of his father. Though, at times, he wasn&#x2019;t sure if Billy&#x2019;s handsome features might better be called a curse. The thought had no sooner occurred to him than he began to hear a raising of the voices at the corner table. </p><p>He turned to Billy and asked, &#x201c;You smiled back at her, didn&#x2019;t you?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know. I mighta,&#x201d; Billy answered. &#x201c;Why?&#x201d; </p><p>Logan gave his younger brother a tired sigh. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s why,&#x201d; he said when the conversation at the corner table suddenly escalated into a loud argument. </p><p>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t own me!&#x201d; the woman exclaimed indignantly, and rose to her feet. </p><p>&#x201c;Set your ass back down!&#x201d; one of the men demanded. &#x201c;Countin&#x2019; all the whiskey you drank, I sure as hell made a down payment on you.&#x201d; His remark brought a laugh from his two companions, who seemed to be enjoying the spat between the two. </p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll set my ass where I damn well please,&#x201d; the woman replied. A large-framed, long-legged woman, with many miles etched into her not unpleasant face, she seemed capable of handling her rough company. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve wasted enough time on you and your friends. You coulda got drunk without me, if that&#x2019;s all you were interested in.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Set down!&#x201d; the man demanded again, and grabbed her wrist. </p><p>Logan glanced at the bartender. Seeing that he was now aware of the potential trouble brewing at the corner table, Logan was satisfied that the bartender would handle the situation before it became violent. As he had figured, Roy walked back to the table where the woman was still standing defiantly before the three men. </p><p>&#x201c;Hey, fellers,&#x201d; he began, &#x201c;ain&#x2019;t no need to get your backs up. Gracie didn&#x2019;t mean nothin&#x2019; by it. Right, Gracie?&#x201d; Gracie didn&#x2019;t answer. She just continued to glare at the belligerent bully holding her wrist. Since Gracie was obviously not inclined to apologize, Roy attempted to appease the quarrelsome brute. &#x201c;Let her go and we&#x2019;ll have the next round on the house. Whaddaya say?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;I ain&#x2019;t takin&#x2019; no sass from a broken-down old whore,&#x201d; the bully replied. He looked back at the woman and said, &#x201c;I told you to set down.&#x201d; To enforce the order, he attempted to pull her down on the chair, but she fought against his efforts. The ensuing struggle knocked the chair over and landed Gracie on the floor, her wrist still captured in the brute&#x2019;s hand. </p><p>&#x201c;Mister,&#x201d; Roy said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m gonna have to ask you and your friends to leave now. I think you&#x2019;ve had enough.&#x201d; </p><p>Fully agitated at that point, the bully clamped down as tight as he could on the woman&#x2019;s wrist while she strained to free herself. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll leave when I&#x2019;m ready to leave,&#x201d; he roared, then threatened, &#x201c;How&#x2019;d you like it if I tore this whole damn place down?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Wouldn&#x2019;t like it,&#x201d; Roy replied. </p><p>To this point, the few other patrons of the saloon had watched in silence. Seeing that things had seemingly gotten out of hand, two of the men got up and made a hasty retreat out the door. &#x201c;Damn,&#x201d; Logan cursed softly when it became obvious that Roy&#x2019;s efforts to defuse a situation already gone bad were not going to succeed, for Logan had no desire to get involved in the altercation. &#x201c;You had to smile at her,&#x201d; he said wearily aside to Billy. </p><p>&#x201c;Hell, I didn&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; Billy replied lamely. </p><p>By now, Gracie was desperate to free herself from the brute&#x2019;s clutches. When her struggles proved useless, she resorted to attacking his arm with her fingernails. &#x201c;Yow!&#x201d; her captor roared in pain, and struck her roughly with a backhand across her face. </p><p>That was as much as the Cross brothers could tolerate. Logan was the first to move. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s far enough,&#x201d; he stated emphatically as he rose to his feet. &#x201c;Billy, go over there by the door and take care of those weapons.&#x201d; He walked over to the corner table to confront the troublemakers. &#x201c;All right, the man here asked you politely to get outta his saloon. Now I&#x2019;m tellin&#x2019; you that it&#x2019;s time for you to turn the lady loose and do what he says.&#x201d; </p><p>His statement was enough to cause the bully to release his hold on Gracie, but he got to his feet and kicked his chair back. &#x201c;And just who do you think you are, big mouth?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m the feller who&#x2019;s gonna whip your ass if you don&#x2019;t get outta here like I said,&#x201d; Logan said. </p><p>&#x201c;Huh,&#x201d; the brute snorted defiantly, &#x201c;you gonna whip all three of us?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;If I have to,&#x201d; Logan replied calmly. His assessment of the trio told him that they all appeared too drunk to put up much of a fight&#x2014;that, and the fact that the man&#x2019;s two companions did not seem overly enthusiastic about joining in. And he was not discounting Billy&#x2019;s help after his brother finished emptying all the cartridges out of the weapons on the table by the door. </p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s talkin&#x2019; mighty big, ain&#x2019;t he, boys?&#x201d; the bully snarled with a sneer. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s see if he can back it up.&#x201d; He shoved Gracie&#x2019;s chair aside and stepped out in front of the table, only then aware of the effect of the whiskey he had consumed. Spreading his feet wide in an effort to steady himself, he took a wild swing at Logan, missing by a mile. </p><p>Anticipating such a move, Logan ducked down and answered with a hard uppercut under the brute&#x2019;s chin, which caused him to stagger backward onto the table. Woozy from the uppercut, he managed to push himself up from the table only to meet a hard right hand flush on his nose that drove him down on the floor. The back of his head banged against the edge of the table as he went down, knocking him senseless. </p><p>With his adversary flat on the floor, Logan turned to face the man&#x2019;s companions. With a glance at the menacing figure before them, and another at his brother coming toward them now, carrying a rifle in each hand, their decision was simple. &#x201c;We ain&#x2019;t got no quarrel with you, mister. Jake&#x2019;s the one with the problem.&#x201d; </p><p>Logan, still in position to attack, took a step back. &#x201c;Well, get Jake outta here, and go sober up.&#x201d; </p><p>He took the Winchester Billy handed him and stood aside to give the two men room to drag their partner toward the door. Billy followed them and watched while one of the men settled up with the bartender. Then they picked up their empty guns and ...</p></p><h2>And Still I Rise: Black America Since MLK</h2><p><p>The companion book to Henry Louis Gates, Jr.&#x2019;s PBS series, <em>And Still I Rise</em>&#x2014;a timeline and chronicle of the past fifty years of black history in the U.S. in more than 350 photos.</p><p>Beginning with the assassination of Malcolm X in February 1965, <em>And Still I Rise: From Black Power to the White House</em> explores the last half-century of the African American experience. More than fifty years after the passage of the Civil Rights Act and the birth of Black Power, the United States has both a black president and black CEOs running Fortune 500 companies&#x2014;and a large black underclass beset by persistent poverty, inadequate education, and an epidemic of incarceration. Harvard professor and scholar Henry Louis Gates, Jr. raises disturbing and vital questions about this dichotomy. How did the African American community end up encompassing such profound contradictions? And what will &#x201c;the black community&#x201d; mean tomorrow?</p><p>Gates takes readers through the major historical events and untold stories of the sixty years that have irrevocably shaped both the African American experience and the nation as a whole, from the explosive social and political changes of the 1960s, into the 1970s and 1980s&#x2014;eras characterized by both prosperity and neglect&#x2014;through the turn of the century to today, taking measure of such racial flashpoints as the Tawana Brawley case, OJ Simpson&#x2019;s murder trial, the murders of Amadou Diallo and Trayvon Martin, and debates around the NYPD&#x2019;s &#x201c;stop and frisk&#x201d; policies. Even as it surveys the political and social evolution of black America, <em>And Still I Rise</em> is also a celebration of the accomplishments of black artists, musicians, writers, comedians, and thinkers who have helped to define American popular culture and to change our world.</p></p><p><p>A companion to the PBS series <em>And Still I Rise</em>, hosted and produced by the preeminent harvard scholar Henry Louis Gates, Jr.</p><p>This illustrated chronology details the most salient events of the last half century in African American history, from the climactic moments of the civil rights movement&#x2014;the assassinations of Malcolm X and Martin Luther King, Jr., and the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965&#x2014;and the once unimaginable, and now nearly complete, two-term presidency of Barack H. Obama.</p><p>From Selma to Ferguson, affirmative action to the <em>Forbes</em> list, Motown to Def Jam, "Black Is Beautiful" to "Black Lives Matter," <em>And Still I Rise</em> is a record of a people who have made astonishing progress since the King years, climbing to the highest rungs of society and revolutionizing global culture, but who also confront daunting challenges within a nation still struggling over issues of inequality.</p><p>The authors' year-by-year approach vividly chronicles the people and events that have irrevocably shaped the African American community and the nation as a whole. At the root of <em>And Still I Rise</em> is a seemingly simple question: What binds African Americans together? Is it the inheritance of memories and experiences across time? Is it the legacy born of fighting a system of laws that, for such a long portion of American history, drew a color line based on "one drop of blood?" Is it the common cause that has come from fighting for freedom and equality, or the cultural ties that unite a people through the cultural and social institutions, the sacred and secular forms and songs that speak to their epic journey? Or, given the sheer diversity and divergence of some forty million people, is it even possible to think of this "nation-within-a-nation" as a unified cultural or social entity at all?</p><p>Accompanying photographs of signal moments in the political and social evolution of Black America are images of the accomplishments of black thinkers and artists, entertainers and writers, sports figures and businesswomen and -men, professionals and workers, who have helped to define American culture, in all of its manifestations. Comprehensive but in no way exhaustive, <em>And Still I Rise</em> is intended to start a conversation, within and between generations and races.</p><p>Henry Louis Gates, Jr., is the Alphonse Fletcher University Professor and the director of the W.

Curious, Paul follows Kenneth and catches him trying to dispose of two bodies.</p><p>That was eight months ago.</p><p>After nearly losing his own life that night, Paul is battling PTSD and depression. To cheer him up, his wife, Charlotte, gives him a present: a vintage typewriter&#x2014;complete with ink ribbons and heavy round keys.

We pooled our knowledge and experience to come up with an adventure guide for hiking, mountain biking, driving and camping outings for the public to enjoy. All of these trips are land-based adventures. The book provides a detailed guide to 55 hiking and mountain biking trips as well as a mile-by-mile guide to the 100-mile Owyhee Uplands Backcountry Byway. The guide offers a ton of adventures close to home in the Owyhee Front, plus hiking and backpacking tips for the new Owyhee Wilderness areas. Be aware that many of the hiking adventures are self-guided adventures with no trails per se. You will need to follow our directions closely, plus it would be handy to bring supplemental maps with you such as topo maps, BLM maps and a GPS unit to ensure a successful adventure. Be sure to read our Owyhee Canyonlands survival guide chapter before you go. There are little to no services in Owyhee County, meaning you need to bring all of your food and water with you, and your vehicle should be in ready for a rough and rocky adventure. If it is rainy and wet out there, the unimproved roads will turn into gumbo, often making them impassible. Use common sense. Have fun out there in the Owyhees! There s just something special about a place that is so huge that it makes you feel small, really small in the whole scheme of things. You will be awe-struck by the many box canyons and the variety of caves, spires, honeycombs, and unique rock formations you encounter. With each new adventure, you may find yourself touched by the Owyhees in a way that makes you want to come back for more.</p><p>Steve Stuebner is the author of more than 10 outdoor books, including the Boise Trail Guide: 75 Hiking and Running Routes Close to Home, Mountain Biking in Boise, Boise Road Cycling Guide, Paddling the Payette, and more.

M. Nouwen is one of the most popular spiritual writers of our time. He wrote more than forty books, among them the bestselling Out of Solitude. He taught at the University of Notre Dame, as well as Yale and Harvard Universities. From 1986 until his death in 1996, he was part of the L Arche Daybreak community in Toronto, where he shared his life with people with mental disabilities.Art was Vincent Van Gogh's road to personal salvation, a direction he took only after abandoning his career as lay Methodist minister in England and evangelist preacher in the Belgian mines, maintains the author. In this specialized, philosophically arguable, illustrated study, Edwards ( Christian Being and Doing ) broadly interpets Van Gogh's paintings as a moral-religious drama, claiming the tormented artist found a gateway to spiritual unity with God through solitude in nature. He further argues that Van Gogh's conversion experience in his early 20s was not the result of obsession or of a thwarted love affair, as many scholars believe, but of a deep-seated hunger for ultimate answers. Examining the painter's fascination with Japanese ukiyo-e ("floating world") prints, which Van Gogh passionately collected, the author links his awareness of life as constant flux to the outlook of Zen Buddhism. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>A Pig, a Fox, and Stinky Socks</h2><p><b>The stars of Jonathan Fenske's 2016 Theodor Seuss Geisel Honor book,&nbsp;<i>A Pig, a Fox, and a Box</i>, are back!</b><br><br>Pig and Fox are back&#x2014;and so are their shenanigans!

He lives in Denver, Colorado.</p><h2>Prophet, Priest, and King: The Roles of Christ in the Bible and Our Roles Today</h2><p>Although early church fathers recognized the different roles of Christ, John Calvin was the first to call attention to his distinct offices of prophet, priest, and king. Starting in Genesis, these offices recur time and again throughout the Bible. Viewed alongside Christ&#39;s humiliation and exultation, they give us a fully rounded understanding of his work, as well as insight into the ongoing work of the church. In this biblical theology, Richard Belcher explores and defines the basic functions of prophets, priests, and kings through an analysis of key Old Testament texts before discussing the fulfillment of these offices in Christ and the transformation of these offices for the church, its leaders, and individual believers. Includes study questions.</p><p><b>Richard P. Belcher Jr.</b> is Professor of Old Testament and Academic Dean at Reformed Theological Seminary in Charlotte. He is author of <i>The Messiah and the Psalms</i> and commentaries on Genesis and Ecclesiastes and has a decade of pastoral experience."Belcher's impressive treatment of these offices in their biblical-theological setting is essential reading in understanding their comprehensive nature. This book deftly combines biblical and pastoral insight that is most welcome in furthering our understanding of Scripture and the person and work of Christ." --<b>Derek W. H. Thomas</b>, Senior Minister, First-Presbyterian Church, Columbia<br><br>"With wisdom, clarity, and grace, Belcher guides the reader to a richer and fuller vision of Christ as Prophet, Priest, and King." --<b>Michael J. Kruger</b>, President and Samuel C. Patterson Professor of New Testament, Reformed Theological Seminary, Charlotte<br><br>"Belcher's work points us all toward the importance of keeping the centrality of Christ in view as we address the manifold challenges that Christians face as we long for his return in glory." --<b>Richard L. Pratt Jr.</b>, President, Third Millennium Ministries</p><h2>Hare Brain, Tortoise Mind: How Intelligence Increases When You Think Less</h2><p><p>In these accelerated times, our decisive and businesslike ways of thinking are unprepared for ambiguity, paradox, and sleeping on it." We assume that the quick-thinking "hare brain" will beat out the slower Intuition of the "tortoise mind." However, now research in cognitive science is changing this understanding of the human mind. It suggests that patience and confusion-rather than rigor and certainty-are the essential precursors of wisdom.</p><p>With a compelling argument that the mind works best when we trust our unconscious, or "undermind," psychologist Guy Claxton makes an appeal that we be less analytical and let our creativity have free rein. He also encourages reevaluation of society's obsession with results-oriented thinking and problem-solving under pressure. Packed with Interesting anecdotes, a dozen puzzles to test your reasoning, and the latest related research, <i>Hare Brain, Tortoise Mind</i> is an Illuminating, uplifting, stimulating read that focuses on a new kind of well-being and cognition. </p></p><p>Even though we all learned that "slow and steady wins the race" back in grade school, most of us tackle problems with the brute force of logic. Cognitive scientist Guy Claxton wrote <i>Hare Brain, Tortoise Mind</i> to show us another way. As he says, "voices of philosophy, poetry and imagery are relatively weak in a world that largely assumes that only science and reason speak with true authority." Yet that very authority suggests that there are many problems better served by slower, more intuitive thinking, rather than the linear, logical process Claxton calls the "d-mind." <p> Laboratory studies of subliminal perception, problem solving, and creativity point to a cacophony of intelligent voices murmuring just below our conscious levels of awareness yet influencing our behavior in subtle ways we are only just beginning to understand. Claxton argues persuasively that this unconscious intelligence is just what we need to handle complex situations, and that our culture's misplaced emphasis on logic and reason to the exclusion of all else is foolish, and even hypocritical, as most scientists will readily admit to abandoning their left-brains on occasion for bursts of nonlinear, inspired thinking. But his prose is never preachy; in fact, he sounds as warm and wise as the Buddhist monks he has studied with. If you're looking for a new way of thinking about thinking, you'll find it in <i>Hare Brain, Tortoise Mind</i>. <i>--Rob Lightner</i></p>&#34;The essential guide to creative thinking!&#34;-- John Cleese &#34;Guy Claxton backs up anecdotal studies of creativity with up-to-date Information about the latest research into brain function.

Respect all life</p><p> 2. Live as part of the Animal Kingdom</p><p> 3. Educate our children to respect animals</p><p> 4. Treat animals as you would like to be treated</p><p> 5. Be a steward</p><p> 6. Value the sounds of nature and help preserve them</p><p> 7. Do not harm life in order to learn about it</p><p> 8. Have the courage of your convictions</p><p> 9. Act knowing that your actions make a difference</p><p> 10. Act knowing that you are not alone.</p><p> Filled with inspirational stories, <i>The Ten Trusts</i> provides lessons Jane Goodall has learned from a lifetime of experience, with the warmth and emotion her readers have come to expect from her. Marc Bekoff, cofounder of the Roots and Shoots program with Jane, also contributes his profound insights and research, which Jane has come to rely on. Together, they share their hope and vision for humanity and all the earth's creatures, distilled into ten eloquent spiritual lessons. Within these ten trusts, Goodall reveals how we can gain true enlightenment by living in harmony with the animal kingdom and honoring the interconnection between all species. </p><p> </p></p><p><p>Jane Goodall is one of the world's leading conservationists. The author of many books, including the New York Times bestseller, <em>Reason for Hope,</em> she is renowned for her work with the chimpanzees of Gombe National Park in Tanzania, as well as for her extensive worldwide lecturing on conservation and preservation of all species.</p><br><br><p>Marc Bekoff is professor of biology at the University of Colorado, Boulder. He is the author of many books, including <em>Minding Animals: Awareness, Emotions and Heart,</em> and is a former Guggenheim Fellow and a Fellow of the Animal Behavior Society. Bekoff is also regional coordinator for Jane Goodall's Roots &amp; Shoots program, which promotes environmental awareness and community involvement of young people, senior citizens, and prisoners in over seventy countries through education and hands-on activities.</p>Scientist Goodall's profound compassion and respect for life have induced her to become a tireless activist on behalf of animals, over whom humans hold the power of life and death. Here she teams up with ethologist Bekoff, author of <i>Minding Animals</i> [BKL Ap 1 02], to present a riveting treatise on how to "become better and more compassionate inhabitants of Earth" by embracing 10 "trusts" that will put a stop to animal abuse, environmental destruction, and concomitant human suffering. In deeply moving true-life stories of love and altruism involving various creatures from dogs to a parrot, donkey, and pot-bellied pig, matched by indelible accounts of the healing properties of mutually affectionate human-animal relationships, these two lucid scientists declare once and for all that animals do, as any close observer will attest, possess emotions and intelligence; they do feel pain. This is prelude to harrowing descriptions of how these sentient, most likely sapient beings are routinely tortured in the service of science, medicine, agriculture, cosmetics, and entertainment. Goodall and Bekoff's mission is not to horrify but to inspire. Determinedly optimistic, they insist that every effort to eradicate these crimes against animals, no matter how modest, from buying free-range eggs to supporting animal rights groups, proves that we can still become "wise stewards of life on Earth." An accessible, compelling, and important expose. <i>Donna Seaman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

To get to story time at the library, of course!&nbsp; The children like the chicken, the chicken likes the children, and everyone loves story time. So it&#x2019;s no surprise that more children (and more chickens!) get in on the fun until there are more kids and critters than the librarian knows what to do with. Luckily, she comes up with a creative solution and manages to find little R &amp; R for herself. <br> &nbsp;<br> Fans of <i>Bats in the Library</i> and <i>Library Lion</i> will fall in love and story time will never be the same!</p><p>Sandy Asher is an author, poet, and playwright. &nbsp;She has written over 25 books for young readers, including the award-winning <i>Too Many Frogs! </i>She lives in Lancaster, PA with her husband. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Mark Fearing is an illustrator with many children&#x2019;s book to his credit, including <i>Dilly Dally Daisy</i> and <i>How Martha Saved Her Parents from Green Beans.</i> He currently works across multiple mediums and loves to tell stories using his illustrations. He lives in Portland, OR.PreS-Gr 2&#x2014;Everyone looks forward to the storytime program at the public library. One week, a chicken comes in through the window and joins the entourage of children as they gather around the librarian to hear a story, and a good time is had by all. The next week, a larger crowd of children attend, along with a whole flock of chickens. The session is a bit hectic but is nonetheless a big hit. The following week, there are so many children, and so many chickens, that the beleaguered librarian can't be heard over the din, even with a bullhorn. How can they possibly conduct a storytime? Suddenly, a solution occurs to her&#x2014;she hands out "shelves and shelves of stories" to the children, and they spread out all over the building, each conducting mini-storytimes, reading to the chickens. The vibrant cartoon art captures the suburban library setting with a mix of full-bleed spreads, sequential panels, and increasingly busy (and noisy) scenes. The simple, large-font, cumulative text reinforces several recurring elements (children, chickens, stories) and features the refrain, "Everyone loves storytime."

I wanted to play a bad guy. I wanted to be the psycho villain. I also wanted a villain who was an outsider. In the early drafts of the script, I named the character Herbert Khaury, which is Tiny Tim&#x2019;s real name. Tiny Tim is a hero of mine, but he was also an obsessive nut and a bit of a stalker. Maybe he was a bit more than a bit of a stalker. Maybe Tiny was a little dangerous. Tiny Tim had his problems. For the movie, I parted my hair like him and shaved my stupid beard. Tiny Tim didn&#x2019;t have a beard. Tiny was tall&#x2014;not as tall as me, but still pretty tall, and Tiny was also pretty overweight by the time he was my age. So, being fat was good for the part. I was very happy being fat. At the time of that movie, I was the fattest I&#x2019;ve ever been in my life. I thought fat was good for the part.<br> <br>If you&#x2019;re reading or listening to this book right when Director&#x2019;s Cut comes out, you might see me on some talk shows pimping this book or read an interview or two with me. If you do, you&#x2019;ll hear me talk about gaining all that weight to play my character, Herbie, in the film. You&#x2019;ll hear me spin how fat I was. I don&#x2019;t like the word &#x201c;spin.&#x201d; I prefer the word &#x201c;lie.&#x201d; I&#x2019;m going to be implying very strongly (lying) that I gained all that weight to play my character. It&#x2019;s the worst kind of lie, because by the time I&#x2019;m done with it, I&#x2019;ll believe it. There will be some truth in it, so I can focus on that little truth until the big truth goes away. The weight sincerely was great for the character, and it really made everything perfect for that movie, but I hadn&#x2019;t spent thirty years getting fat because I was planning to play Herbie. I wrote the script about ten years before we shot it . . . but I can&#x2019;t produce any notes that are time-stamped from those days saying, &#x201c;I sure better start eating like a pig to do my best acting.&#x201d; Maybe De Niro just got a hankering for spaghetti while working on Raging Bull and then just spun the press accordingly.<br> <br>By the time you read this, I will believe that I gained over a hundred pounds for my movie; that in order to gain weight for my art, my sacrifice to the muses was to eat everything I saw. I know what it feels like to start spinning, progress to lying, and eventually believe the lies so much that you don&#x2019;t even remember that they started as lies.<br> <br>In 2012 I went on The Celebrity Apprentice with Donald Trump, who has hair that looks like cotton candy made of piss. Before the show was over I published my previous book, Every Day Is an Atheist Holiday!, which stated that Donny&#x2019;s hair looked like cotton candy made of piss. I created the most perfect description of Donald Trump&#x2019;s hair ever given by anyone. &#x201c;Hair like cotton candy made of piss&#x201d; is also the phrase that Trumpy said was his reason for my coming in second a year later on All-Star Celebrity Apprentice. I love that about Trump. He comes out and admits crazy shit like that. He doesn&#x2019;t pretend he&#x2019;s not being arbitrary and petty. His charm is arbitrary and petty. It&#x2019;s supposed to be my job, as bitter loser, to claim that his real reasons were arbitrary and petty, but Trump fucked me on that. He&#x2019;s enough of a real, inspired nut that he just says outright what I would have to claim, and after he does that, all I can do is lie more and write that it was just that one joke, which it wasn&#x2019;t. Trump is the hero here, and I&#x2019;m the bitter loser liar. He just made it easy for me.<br> <br>Part of the final challenge was coming up with an ice cream flavor. If Trump had said that my competitor&#x2019;s ice cream really was better, which it wasn&#x2019;t, I&#x2019;d have a beef; but nope, he was straightforward and honest, and I&#x2019;m the weasel. My hair doesn&#x2019;t look like cotton candy made of piss, but it does look like the tail of a pathetic, aging roadkill raccoon. And if you said that to me, I wouldn&#x2019;t let you win a game I was running even if your ice cream made me cum, but I wouldn&#x2019;t cop to the real reason like Trump did. Trump was a better man than I . . . in this one very specific instance, on his show, with me, on that exact day. I&#x2019;m as aware as everyone else that, since that one day with me, there is ample evidence that in general he is at very best the worst person who ever lived, and the best thing about him is that his hair looks like cotton candy made of piss. Believe me, I&#x2019;m as horrified as you are. My ice cream was better, and my marketing was more successful, but I can be rude, weird, and crazy (and I guess I was), so I shouldn&#x2019;t have won. That&#x2019;s fair, but if I&#x2019;m going to spin that fat ain&#x2019;t my fault, why not lie and say that Donald Trump&#x2019;s temporary, accidentally brave honesty is petty and arbitrary? I&#x2019;m on a roll, spinning down a hill with my old-dead-raccoon-tail hair blowing in the wind.<br> <br>Because of my arbitrary and petty rudeness to Mr. Trump, the people with intellectual disabilities at Opportunity Village, the charity I played Trump&#x2019;s game for, didn&#x2019;t get the quarter-of-a-�million-buck first prize. But, thanks to Trump&#x2019;s honesty and my dishonesty, others involved with The Celebrity Apprentice wrote checks that actually totaled more than two hundred fifty grand. Exposure on Trump&#x2019;s show sold a metric shit-ton of tickets to The Penn &amp; Teller Show at the Penn &amp; Teller Theater in Las Vegas. So, I&#x2019;m a bitter loser who won big by being rude and lying just a little bit. I&#x2019;m actually the big fat bitter loser, because, you know, I gained all that weight to play the part of Herbie in my movie. I&#x2019;m a real artist&#x2014;a bullshit artist. I lie like a rug.<br> <br>The ice cream I created, Vanilla/Chocolate Magic Swirtle, is still available at some Walgreens locations, but it&#x2019;ll probably be gone by the time this book comes out; as I remember, though, it&#x2019;s really good. I added sea salt (which is just salt) to dark chocolate, swirled that into vanilla ice cream, and threw in some caramel &#x201c;turtle-like&#x201d; candies. It&#x2019;s good ice cream. La Toya Jackson helped with the great name, and Dennis Rodman let me borrow his palate to get the vanilla base to just the right level of sweet and rich. It tastes great. It&#x2019;s sweet, rich, and comforting. I&#x2019;d have an argument with my wife and then eat a whole container, and that&#x2019;s the grown-up way to live. It&#x2019;s really good ice cream, and you should try it if you ever get a chance. My share of the money goes to Opportunity Village, and it&#x2019;ll be your favorite food ever. And then you&#x2019;ll read the rest of this book and you&#x2019;ll never eat it again. I giveth, and I taketh the fuck away.<br> <br>I take my acting fat seriously. Before the script was really finished, I changed my character&#x2019;s name from Herbert Khaury (it&#x2019;s not right to use Tiny Tim&#x2019;s real name) to Herbert Blount&#x2014;Blount being jazz great Sun Ra&#x2019;s real last name. Sun Ra, another crazy hero of mine, was also really fat. Sun Ra was also from Saturn, so he had an even better excuse than gaining weight for a movie. As part of my dedication to the craft of acting, I&#x2019;d have big fat steaks at the Musso &amp; Frank Grill in Hollywood. I&#x2019;d have big fat steaks everywhere. I ate a shit-ton of bread and butter and buttered popcorn and candy. And grilled cheese. And grilled cheese with bacon. And pizza. And pizza with bacon. I&#x2019;d eat dozens of raspberry-filled Krispy Kreme doughnuts, which, I either read somewhere unreliable or made up, were Elvis&#x2019;s favorite doughnuts. Yum. And Krispy Kreme doughnuts with bacon. Yup. For the past several years, I&#x2019;ve hosted Penn Jillette&#x2019;s Private Bacon and Doughnut Party, a private party coincident in time but not associated with James Randi&#x2019;s The Amaz!ng Meeting for skeptic and atheist cats and kitties in Vegas. I&#x2019;d give everyone free bacon and doughnuts and play dirty-ass rock &#x2019;n&#x2019; roll with nearly naked men and women all around me. It&#x2019;s all part of my plan:<br> <br>Sell ice cream.<br> <br>Give away bacon and doughnuts.<br> <br>Get really fat for a movie.<br> <br>Write this book to inspire all the fat fucks I helped encourage to get that fat.<br> <br>I am Wile E. Coyote, Super Genius.<br> <br>By the time we were done shooting Director&#x2019;s Cut, I was fat, depressed, tired all the time, and couldn&#x2019;t walk up a flight of stairs without panting. That&#x2019;s what a serious actor I am. At the end of every Penn &amp; Teller Show, I run up the aisle to the back of the theater and into the lobby to meet audience members, sign autographs, and pose for pictures, and will do so for as long as I&#x2019;m still lucky enough to have people who want those things from me. At my fattest, at my Herbie movie weight, I couldn&#x2019;t do a very light jog down the five stairs from the front of the stage to the aisle without being winded. Even talking in the show was a bit of a strain. Yup&#x2014;I&#x2019;d get winded talking, and all I know how to do is talk. What the fuck? I don&#x2019;t know exactly what I weighed, because when I got that fat, I didn&#x2019;t really weigh myself much. But I was definitely north of 320 pounds. Truth be told, I probably hit 330. If I&#x2019;m willing to beef up my accomplishments, let&#x2019;s spin that with a little goose and make it 3331/3, a little more than half the number of the beast and one-sixth of a ton. Yeah, I like that. One-sixth of a ton. Just six of me would make a ton. Wow, that&#x2019;s one-twenty-seventh of a shit-ton. Shit.<br> <br>Around this time, we started using a live cow in the Penn &amp; Teller Show in Vegas. A cow isn&#x2019;t a very glamorous animal for the Vegas Strip, so we dress her in elephant drag and call her an elephant. We think that&#x2019;s funny. An American cow with a feedbag trunk to make her look like an elephant&#x2014;will that be viewed by future social critics in the same way we now view blackface? I don&#x2019;t know. I plan to be dead by then. The &#x201c;elephant&#x201d; in our show is the size of a small cow. A small cow that we call Elsie onstage. The two cows that play the part of Elsie are actually named Gecky and Star. We had nothing to do with those names, and I have no idea how much weight they each gained for the part. Gecky weighs 1,117 pounds. That&#x2019;s small for an elephant, and even a little small for a cow, but when the Vanish of Elsie, the African Spotted Pygmy Elephant went into the Penn &amp; Teller Show, Penn weighed about one-third of her fake-elephant/real-cow weight. I was a third the size of a cow dressed as an elephant. I was a fat fuck. I was that fat because I take my acting craft seriously, and I like bacon.<br> <br>I couldn&#x2019;t run or really talk, and I had hypertension that was supernatural. I used to walk around knocking on two hundred for the top number (I never notice the bottom number; who cares?). My permissive doc had me on massive doses of six different blood pressure drugs. I got up in the morning and took drugs that made me piss so much and so fast that I couldn&#x2019;t take them before I had to ride to the airport. I had to take them at the airport, because it&#x2019;s more convenient to piss five times on a flight from Vegas to L.A. than to pull the car over during the fifteen-minute ride to the airport.<br> <br>Why did I have such bad hypertension? Because I was one-third the size of a cow dressed as an elephant! But I didn&#x2019;t see it that way. I knew that was part of it, but I couldn&#x2019;t believe that was all of it. I figured I would have high blood pressure anyway. My mom and sister had it, and I have some African- and Aboriginal-American ancestry, and it&#x2019;s . . . you know, genetic. I was born a fat fuck like you were born gay. Jesus fucking Christ, I&#x2019;m an idiot.<br> <br>My doc would tell me to lose weight, and I knew he was right, but . . . I didn&#x2019;t see myself as fat. Or, rather, I saw myself as fat but didn&#x2019;t see fat as a problem. My job didn&#x2019;t depend on my weight one way or the other. When I got acting jobs, I either played myself or a fat guy just like me. Penn &amp; Teller were never sold as attractive sex symbols; we didn&#x2019;t have the sex-symbol hand to play. My showbiz success was not tied to my weight. I was married and didn&#x2019;t have to worry about getting fucked. Some people didn&#x2019;t use &#x201c;fucking fat&#x201d; as the first two words to describe me because I&#x2019;m also fucking tall. I&#x2019;m six foot seven, so I&#x2019;m a big guy. &#x201c;Big guy&#x201d; includes &#x201c;fat,&#x201d; but it&#x2019;s not just fat. I carried my weight really well, except for the blood pressure that was on the verge of making me drop dead or stroke out every second of every day. I was fine. I was happy, except for the constant depression and being winded just thinking about running to play with my children. I was a miserable fat fuck with such a great job, a great family, and wonderful friends that I was theoretically and psychologically happy even at one-third the weight of a cow dressed like a fucking elephant.<br> <br>Oh, the things I&#x2019;ve done for art!</p><h2>Goodnight Songs: Illustrated by Twelve Award-Winning Picture Book Artists (Volume 1)</h2><p><i>&#x201c;Baby sail the seven seas<br> Safely in my arms<br> When the waves go up and down<br> You are safe from harm.&#x201d;</i><br> &nbsp;<br> Now this <i>New York Times</i> bestselling collection of charming lullabies by Margaret Wise Brown (<i>Goodnight Moon</i>) comes in an adorable board edition&#x2014;still gorgeously illustrated by 12 award-winning artists. The roster of celebrated names includes Carin Berger, whose <i>The Little Yellow Leaf</i> was a <i>New York Times</i> Best Illustrated Children's Book; Eric Puybaret, who brought the bestselling <i>Puff, the Magic Dragon</i> to life on the page; Coretta Scott King Honor Award winner Sean Qualls; and Caldecott Honor medalist Melissa Sweet.

Several generations have grown up with her timeless stories and her influence has been felt around the world.PreS&#x2014;This unique book was a long time in the making: more than 20 years ago, various unpublished works of the late, great author were discovered in her sister's barn, including many song lyrics. Presented here for the first time are 12 of Brown's lullabies, each one illustrated by a different award-winning picture-book artist. Each spread showcases the unique style of the illustrator and brings to life Brown's dulcet text. In "the noon balloon," Renata Liwska's dreamy pencil work is used to full effect as softly textured animals drift away for a midday snooze. Sean Qualls's fanciful and luminous nighttime sky perfectly accompanies the text: "When the man in the moon was a little boy.... He ran away with a shooting star." Carin Berger's collage scene for "When I Close My Eyes at Night" features 3D-like silhouettes of a sleeping village and billowing clouds that look like striped pajama pants. Nine other artists lend their talents, including Jonathan Bean, Sophie Blackall, Linda Bleck, Christopher Silas Neal, Zachariah Ohora, Eric Puybaret, Isabel Roxas, Melissa Sweet, and Dan Yaccarino. There is a timeless feel to many of Brown's lyrics ("Sleep like a rabbit, sleep like a bear./Sleep like the old cat under the chair"; "Baby, sail the seven seas/Safely in my arms. When the waves go up and down/You are safe from harm"), and children will respond to the gentle rhythms and soothing language.

In <i>Great Books,</i> he leads us on a glorious tour, a rediscovery and celebration of such authors as Homer and Boccaccio, Locke and Nietzsche. Conrad and Woolf. The resulting personal odyssey is an engaging blend of self-discovery, cultural commentary, reporting, criticism, and autobiography -- an inspiration for anyone in love with the written word.</p><p>David Denby, New York city movie critic and journalist, entered Columbia University in 1991 to take the university&#39;s famous course in &#34;Great Books.&#34; This is the course that, in preserving the notion of the western canon without apology to multiculturalists and feminists, has been an unlikely focus of America&#39;s culture war in recent years. Where other universities have caved in and revised or enlarged the canon, Columbia&#39;s course has remained intact. Denby&#39;s intention as a writer and protagonist in the culture war was to record the experience and the personal impact of the course. He has produced a cry from the heart in favor of the classics of western civilization, relaying with infectious enthusiasm how literature touched his soul.At the age of forty-eight, film critic David Denby, dissatisfied with his life within the media bubble, went back to Columbia University and took again the two famous courses in Western classics (Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization) required of all students--courses he first took in 1961. In recent years, collections of literary and philosophical masterpieces such as those taught in these courses have been reviled by the left as oppressive and exclusionary and adored by the right as bulwarks of patriotism. Denby, the film critic for <i>New York</i> magazine, wanted to dispel these cliches and to confront the books in their naked power; he wanted to find the self he had lost in a daze of media images. <p> In <i>Great Books</i>, Denby lives the common adult fantasy of returning to school with some worldly knowledge and experience of life. A gifted storyteller, he leads us on a glorious tour--by turns eloquent, witty, and moving--through the works themselves and through his experiences as a middle-aged man among freshmen. He recounts his failures and triumphs as a reader and student (taking an exam led to a hilarious near-breakdown). He celebrates his rediscovery or new appreciation of such authors as Homer, Plato, the biblical writers, Augustine, Boccaccio, Hegel, Austen, Marx, Nietzsche, and Virginia Woolf. He re-creates the atmosphere of the classroom--the strategies used by a remarkable group of teachers and the strengths and weaknesses of media-age students as they grapple with these difficult, sometimes frightening works. And all year long he watches the students grow and his own life and memories break out of hiding. </p><p>The result is an extraordinarily engaging blend of criticism, reporting, autobiography, and cultural commentary, a book about self-discovery. Denby offers a nonprofessor's look at life on campus; he addresses the vexing questions of political correctness and relativism, and he suggests that a larger crisis surrounds the teaching of the humanities. A liberal defending "the canon," Denby places literature in its revolutionary role as the source of powerful stories--the most powerful stories that we tell about ourselves. For the reader who once read these works, the book is a brilliant reprise; for the reader unfamiliar with them, <i>Great Books offers an irresistible introduction. By the end, the great works are revealed again in their power to disturb and give pleasure.</i></p></p><h2>The Girl Guide: 50 Ways to Learn to Love Your Changing Body</h2><p><p><strong>For every tween girl wondering about her changing body and changing brain, this funny and&nbsp;highly illustrated guide is&nbsp;the answer.

Each chapter focuses on a specific topic such as menstruation, body hair, growing breasts, and stress. The accompanying personal photos, inspirational quotes, artwork, and graphic design elements add a unique touch. Many of the illustrations feature girls of different races, skin tones, shapes, and sizes, thereby giving readers the ability to feel seen and more connected to the book. Throughout the narrative, Ibrahim advocates body positivity, loving oneself, laughing at commonly shared embarrassing moments, and supporting other girls. While her writing is often humorous in tone, Ibrahim carefully addresses experiencing unwanted attention and feeling objectified or unsafe. Frustratingly, however, she does not adequately address sexuality and gender. The chapter on crushes uses they/them pronouns when referring to the crush but a later segment does briefly discuss one involving a boy, leaving same-sex crushes unaddressed. Additionally, there isn't a recommended resources list. Nevertheless, Ibrahim's book is undoubtedly helpful. VERDICT A valuable addition to elementary and middle school and public library collections to help readers better understand and be more comfortable with their bodies and feelings.&#x2014;Jess Gafkowitz, Brooklyn Public Library</p><h2>Man &amp; Horse: The Long Ride Across America</h2><p>In 1974 a disenfranchised young man from a broken home set out to do the impossible. With a hundred dollars in his pocket, a beat up cavalry saddle, and a faraway look in his eye, John Egenes saddled his horse Gizmo and started down the trail on an adventure across the North American continent. Their seven month journey took them across 11 states from California to Virginia, ocean to ocean.. As they left the pressing confinement of the city behind them, the pair experienced the isolation and loneliness of the southwestern deserts, the vastness of the prairie, and the great landscapes that make up America. Across hundreds of miles of empty land they slept with coyotes and wild horses under the stars, and in urban areas they camped alone in graveyards and abandoned shacks. Along the way John and Gizmo were transformed from inexperienced horse and rider to veterans of the trail. With his young horse as his spiritual guide John slowly began to comprehend his own place in the world and to find peace within himself. Full of heart and humor, Egenes serves up a tale that&#39;s as big as the America he witnessed, an America that no longer exists. It was a journey that could only have been experienced step by step, mile by mile, from the view between a horse&#39;s ears.</p><p></p><h2>If I Stay</h2><p>In a single moment, <i>everything</i> changes.

Is YA literature a departure for you?</b></p> <p> Gayle Forman: Actually, it&#x2019;s more of a homecoming. My first writing job was at Seventeen, where I spent five years on staff and as a contributor reporting the magazine&#x2019;s social-issues stories. I loved writing for teens then because&#x2014;contrary to popular opinion&#x2014;they really care about serious issues (from child soldiers in Africa to kids embroiled in the drug war here) and the engage in their reading with such passion. So, now that I&#x2019;m writing young-adult literature, it feels like I&#x2019;ve come full circle. </p> <p><b>Q: This book explores some serious themes. Why is this a book for kids and not adults?</b> </p><p> GF: It&#x2019;s a book for kids precisely because it explores serious themes. Teenagers are grappling with choices about life and love as much as adults, so why shouldn&#x2019;t their reading reflect that? I don&#x2019;t set out to write YA. It just seems like I&#x2019;m drawn to stories about young people. That said, I think If I Stay is for adults, too. I love the idea of teens reading this book and then handing it off to their parents. </p> <p><b>Q: Many key characters are serious musicians, and songs are referenced throughout the book. Are you a musician?</b></p> <p> GF: No. Except for piano lessons when I was a kid and a brief spate of guitar playing in my teens, I&#x2019;ve never played an instrument. I am, however, a huge music fan. And my husband is a musician; he was playing in a punk band when we met, so I&#x2019;ve spent a lot of my life ensconced in that scene. I seem drawn to writing about musicians, though I&#x2019;ve never been all that interested in the cello until Mia popped into my head. </p> <p><b>Q: What inspired you to write this book? </b></p> <p> GF: Music. Oregon. People I have loved. And unfortunately, the book is inspired by a real-life tragedy that happened several years ago.</p> <p><b>Q: This is a book about death, but it&#x2019;s not depressing. Why is that?</b></p> <p> GF: Maybe because it&#x2019;s really about the power of love&#x2014;of family, friends, music&#x2014;and therefore it ultimately affirms life.</p>Gayle Forman is an award-winning, internationally bestselling author and journalist.

He lives in Maryland.CHAPTER ONE<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Family Ties<br> &nbsp;<br> Hands tied behind his back, Han Solo stumbled as the guards shoved him into the gloomy audience chamber. He realized a moment too late that the floor of the central area was a half meter below the level of the entrance. Moving too fast to stop, he fell over the edge. His shoulder slammed down onto the hard stone floor.<br> &nbsp;<br> Han rolled over onto his side, then levered himself up into a sitting position. The guards who had shoved him into the chamber stepped back out and slammed the portal shut behind them. Han was alone in the echoing gloom.<br> &nbsp;<br> He looked around, wondering what was next. At least he was out of that cell. That was something. Not much, maybe, but something. And of course, whatever came next was not likely to be an improvement. In his experience, it was reasonably safe to be filed away in a cell. It was when you were pulled out that the trouble began.<br> &nbsp;<br> Han got himself up onto his feet and looked around. The walls and floors of the place were made of some sort of utilitarian dark gray stresscrete, and there was a dank scent to the air that suggested the windowless chamber was underground. The room was about twenty meters wide and thirty long, with the central floor set a half meter below a two-meter-wide platform that ran around the chamber&#x2019;s perimeter. There were four heavy steel doors, one on each side of the chamber, each of them opening out onto the perimeter platform. Anyone who stood on the platform would be looking down at whoever was in the central area.<br> &nbsp;<br> The door he had entered was at his back, and he was facing a not quite thronelike chair made of dark wood on the opposite side of the perimeter platform. The chair was large and grand enough that whoever got into it would probably be taller sitting than standing. Han would have an eye-level view of the occupant&#x2019;s knees. That chair told him a good deal about why he was here, and who was going to see him.<br> &nbsp;<br> Han continued his survey of the chamber. Aside from the throne chair, the place was undecorated, and poorly lit. Nor was it that well made. There were cracks in the floor, and whatever sort of stresscrete they had used in the walls was crumbly-looking. A rush job.<br> &nbsp;<br> Han had been in a lot of impressive places, and a lot of places that tried to be impressive. This place definitely fit into the second category. The Human League had clearly wanted a chamber that would overawe its prisoners as the Hidden Leader sat in judgment&#x2014;or watched them die for the fun of it&#x2014;but clearly the League hadn&#x2019;t had the time or resources for a first-class job. All very interesting, but it wasn&#x2019;t the sort of information that might help keep him alive.<br> &nbsp;<br> Han turned his attention back to the chair. That was obviously where the Big Man would sit when he got here&#x2014;and Han had a very good idea of who the Big Man was going to be.<br> &nbsp;<br> There was really only one man it could be. His cousin, Thrackan Sal-Solo. Good old murderous, scheming, vindictive, paranoid Thrackan. That was the who, but what was the why? At a minimum, Thrackan wanted to get a look at Han. There was good news and bad news in that. Obviously, they had been keeping him alive for this meeting. But would they have any reason to keep him alive afterward? Did Thrackan have any further use for him?<br> &nbsp;<br> After all, Han had blown up half a squadron of Pocket Patrol Boats. That was offense enough to get a fellow executed most places, and this place was no better than most.<br> &nbsp;<br> Nor would his relationship to Thrackan do him any good. Once Thrackan had indulged his curiosity, he would be quite capable of killing Han on the spot.<br> &nbsp;<br> No, Han knew he wasn&#x2019;t going to live through this because of family feeling. He would have to make himself seem valuable to Thrackan if he wanted to survive. But he had no intention of being the slightest help to Thrackan&#x2019;s Human League.<br> &nbsp;<br> So how to seem to be valuable without actually doing these thugs any good?<br> &nbsp;<br> Han heard something moving on the other side of the doors behind the not-quite-throne. He had run out of time for thinking.<br> &nbsp;<br> Han backed away a step or two from the door. If Thrackan the adult was anything like the Thrackan of Han&#x2019;s childhood, he was going to have to be careful, very careful, in the way he played this. Thrackan, as he recalled, had been quite young when he had started making a show of pulling the wings off insects and beating up smaller children. He had found out very early just how loudly a reputation for cruelty could speak. Here&#x2019;s what I do to someone I&#x2019;m not even mad at. What do you think will happen if I get mad at you? There were those in the Galaxy for whom cruelty, threats, and intimidation were art forms. Not Thrackan. He used them as blunt instruments, weapons. Which was not to say that he did not enjoy his work.<br> &nbsp;<br> The doors swung fully open and a double line of seedy-looking men in officers&#x2019; uniforms came in. One column turned and marched around the corner of the platform to the left of the throne, the other to the right. The two columns lined up on the perimeter platform to either side of the big chair, turned, and faced forward, eyes straight ahead, staring at each other across the center of the room, right over Han&#x2019;s head.<br> &nbsp;<br> Judging by the insignia, which seemed to follow the old Imperial pattern, these were some very senior officers indeed. But today&#x2019;s field marshals had, no doubt, been yesterday&#x2019;s malcontents. Fancy uniforms and a forest of shoulder pips did not make the wearer a seasoned officer worthy of respect. These fellows were no more the equals of the Imperial officers of the past than a child with a toy lightsaber would be a match for Luke Skywalker.<br> &nbsp;<br> By the looks of their paunches, none of them had done any real training in years. Their bleary eyes, flushed faces, and unshaved jaws&#x2014;and the smell of strong drink that wafted in with them&#x2014;told Han that at least some of these very grand officers had been doing some fairly serious celebrating the night before. That was a bit premature. How could even the most drunken of fools think that the Human League had won already?<br> &nbsp;<br> Plainly, this crowd was not made up of Galaxy-class minds. They were here as window dressing, and nothing more. Han paid them no more mind. He turned his attention back to the open door behind the big chair. There was a moment&#x2019;s delay, either because the Great Man was running late, or because someone thought it made for a more dramatic entrance. But then, Thrackan Sal-Solo, onetime Hidden Leader of the Human League, and now the self-declared Diktat of the Corellian Sector&#x2014;came into the room. He walked with the brisk, steady confidence of a man who knew exactly what he was doing and where he was going, a man absolutely certain he could do the job at hand. Thrackan Sal-Solo stepped around the right-hand side of the big chair, came forward to the edge of the platform and paused there a moment. He stared long and hard at his long-lost cousin, and Han stared back.<br> &nbsp;<br> Han felt as if he were staring into a strange, distorting mirror. Thrackan wore Han&#x2019;s face, or else Han wore his. Not that one could not be told from the other. Thrackan&#x2019;s hair was darker, a black-brown shot through with gray. He was a few kilos heavier, and he had a neatly trimmed beard. Thrackan was perhaps two or three centimeters taller than Han. There was a harshness, a ruthlessness, not just in Thrackan&#x2019;s expression, but in the set of his face, as if that look of anger and suspicion was the one his face fell into most naturally.<br> &nbsp;<br> But even those differences did little more than emphasize how much they were alike. Han felt as if that imaginary mirror were showing him the man he might have been. He did not like the idea. Not one little bit. This first meeting was a lot more disconcerting than he had expected it to be.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was not just Han who saw the resemblance. The uniformed types that lined the two sides of the room were obviously supposed to keep eyes ahead, but not one of them could resist the temptation to stare first at Han, and then at Thrackan. Small murmurs of astonishment filled the room.<br> &nbsp;<br> Indeed, it seemed as if Thrackan were the only one who did not find it all off-putting. He looked down at Han with a calm and steady gaze.<br> &nbsp;<br> Han decided he had better do his best to take it all in stride as well. Or at least pretend. &#x201c;Hello, Thrackan,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I sort of figured I&#x2019;d be seeing you.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;And hello to you, Han,&#x201d; his cousin replied, in a voice that was startlingly similar to Han&#x2019;s. &#x201c;Some things never change, do they?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not exactly sure I know what you mean.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Back in the old days, Han,&#x201d; Thrackan said. &#x201c;Back in the old days. You were always the one who liked to play games. And I was always the one who had to come in and clean up after you.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s not exactly the way I remember it,&#x201d; Han said. Thrackan had never cleaned up after himself, let alone anyone else. But he had always been good at making it seem like he had. Most bullies were good at playing the victim. Thrackan had never had the slightest problem blaming others for his foul-ups, or taking all the credit for someone else&#x2019;s effort and success. &#x201c;But you&#x2019;re right,&#x201d; Han went on. &#x201c;Some things never change.&#x201d;</p><h2>Guitar World Presents Dimebag Darrell's Riffer Madness: Book &amp; Online Audio</h2><p>Metal is back!

For Husserl, the adjective "European" meant the spiritual identity that extends beyond geographical Europe (to America, for instance) and that was born with ancient Greek philosophy. In his view, this philosophy, for the first time in history, apprehended the world (the world as a whole) as a question to be answered. It interrogated the world not in order to satisfy this or that practical need but because "the passion to know had seized mankind."</p><p>The crisis Husserl spoke of seemed to him so profound that he wondered whether Europe was still able to survive it. The roots of the crisis lay for him at the beginning of the Modern Era, in Galileo and Descartes, in the one-sided nature of the European sciences, which reduced the world to a mere object of technical and mechanical investigation and put the concrete world of life, die Lebenswelt as he called it, beyond their horizon.</p><p>The rise of the sciences propelled man into the tunnels of the specialized disciplines. The more he advanced in knowledge, the less clearly could he see either the world as a whole or his own self, and he plunged further into what Husserl's pupil Heidegger called, in a beautiful and almost magical phrase, "the forgetting of being."</p><p>Once elevated by Descartes to "master and proprietor of, nature," man has now become a mere thing to the forces (of technology, of politics, of history) that bypass him, surpass him, possess him. To those forces, man's concrete being, his "world of life" (die Lebenswelt), has neither value nor interest: it is eclipsed, forgotten from the start.</p></p><h2>Halston: Inventing American Fashion</h2><p><b>INDIEFAB Book of the Year Awards -- 2014 GOLD Winner for Popular Culture<br><br></b>Written by Halston&#x2019;s niece and confidante, this is the first monograph to chronicle the designer&#x2019;s life and his glamorous, minimalist aesthetic that personified American fashion in the electric 1970s. After rising in the fashion world from his beginnings as a milliner for Bergdorf Goodman, Roy Halston Frowick (1932&#x2013;1990) launched his eponymous womenswear label in 1968, buoyed by his connections with socialites and celebrities. As the creator of Jackie Kennedy&#x2019;s signature pillbox hat and as Liza Minnelli&#x2019;s fashion guru throughout the 1970s and &#x2019;80s, Halston was synonymous both with American style&#x2019;s modern, glamorous look and an A-list clientele. The Halston look continues to be revered today as a marker of American fashion at its peak. This book chronicles the ultrachic Halston&#x2019;s journey from his homespun roots to the acme of urban fame, illustrated through the lens of the author&#x2019;s personal archives and early sketches, as well as unseen Joe Eula and Stephen Sprouse drawings. His story unfolds through the author&#x2019;s interviews with Jane Holzer, Marisa Berenson, Joel Schumacher, and Jeffrey Bilhuber, among others, all of whose personal narratives are essential to Halston&#x2019;s enduring legacy. Spotlighting his most important design achievements and his collaborations with luminaries such as Martha Graham, Elsa Peretti, and Hiro, this book presents to readers the untold story of Halston and solidifies hisplace as a key designer in American fashion.</p><p>Lesley Frowick, one of Halston&#x2019;s six nieces, is a photographer and the cocurator of Halston and Warhol: Silver and Suede at the Warhol Museum, Pittsburgh (May 2014). Liza Minnelli is one of the most versatile, highly regarded, and best-selling entertainers in television and stage history. Halston created Liza&#x2019;s most unforgettable and iconic costumes for many of her performances. She continues to wear his fashions today.<b><b>&#x201c;</b></b>Written by Halston&#x2019;s niece and confidante, the pages reflect his glamorous, minimalist aesthetic that personified American fashion in the electric 1970s.&#x201d; &#x2013;<i>Society Diaries</i><br><br>"This book breathes fresh vitality into his (Halston's) legacy.<i>" &#x2013;Chicago Tribune<br></i><br>&#x201c;Without question Lesley Frowick has written an endearing and intimate telling of her beloved uncle, Roy Halston Frowick...telling of his life is a love letter and paean to his legacy...The best way to summarize this book is to say that Ms. Frowick has approached the life of this designer as a sentimental journey.

From the internal struggles of balancing glory and humility, to the mental struggles of confidence and self-defeat, &#34;The Wrestler&#34; brings the reader into the competitive arena. And often times, aspects of this arena are hidden. What occurs in the heat of battle on the mat is only half the story. This book helps current competitors recognize what exactly they&#39;re participating in. It seeks to help them appreciate the unique qualities of the sport, to recognize what they are gaining from it, and to craft a competitive approach that makes the most of their time as a wrestler.</p><p>Michael Fessler is a writer, speaker, and the author of &#34;Faith and Wrestling&#34; and &#34;They&#39;re Just Not Interested&#34;. He was a wrestler for many years and has served as a wrestling coach as well. Fessler lives in Minnesota with his wife and two children. He has a BA in Biblical and Theological Studies (Bethel University) and an MA in Communications (Concordia University - Saint Paul)."Michael Fessler's book <i>The Wrestler</i> is a must read for anyone who has participated in the sport of wrestling. This book masterfully shares the struggle that everyone who has dared to put on a singlet and stand in the middle of the ring has had to face. Wrestling is tough. This sport exposes one's character and compels you to do the hard work in growing through the challenges that are exposed. Wrestling forces you to confront those inner demons. You are tempted to choose the undemanding way. The struggle of the wrestler is found in the decision to push toward the uncomfortable path filled with blood, sweat and tears. This book helps to keep the fire fanned toward growing through the inevitable challenges that come with the sport. The reader is reminded that the making of a champion is an intense burning desire. Michael Fessler's newest book will be required reading for my wrestlers before each season begins. I plan on referring to the stories and thoughts that Michael has shared from his personal journey throughout our wrestling season. Every wrestler will identify with the stories and journey because it is the way of the grappler. The challenge is learning to love the process through the hard work regardless of the outcome. Coach and author Michael Fessler teaches the lessons of a wrestler that enable them to become a champion, not only on the mat, but a champion in life."<b><br>- DAN RUSSELL</b>, 4x NCAA D2 National Champion, and the author of <i>Finish Strong</i><br><br>"I read <i>The Wrestler</i> and loved it!

Is the whale dead? While the man worries about losing their net, the boy worries about the whale. He remembers the fear he felt when, caught in a net himself in childhood, he almost drowned before being rescued by his father. When the whale blinks an enormous eye, the boy knows that he has to try to save the creature, no matter how dangerous doing so may be. </p><p>Expressive and perfectly paced, this powerful story, <i>The Boy and the Whale</i>, by Caldecott Medal&#x2013;winner Mordicai Gerstein was inspired in part by a real-life video of a whale&#x2019;s rescue, and the creature&#x2019;s joyful dance through the waves after being freed.</p></p><p><b>Mordicai Gerstein</b> was born in in Los Angeles, California, where he attended Chouinard Art Institute. Upon graduation, he moved to New York City, where he worked at designing and directing animated films for television and met the writer, Elizabeth Levy, with whom he created the Something Queer Is Going On series of mystery picture books. This experience inspired him to write and illustrate over forty of his own books, several of which have been named <i>New York Times</i> Notable and Best Illustrated Books. He received the 2004 Caldecott Medal for <i>The Man Who Walked Between the Towers.</i> Mordicai lives in western Massachusetts with his wife, Susan.Gr 1&#x2013;5&#x2014; As the sun rises, a boy sees something big out in the sea&#x2014;a whale. The boy Abelardo and his fisherman father ride their panga out to the whale who is caught in their fishing net. Pragmatic Papa is concerned about his net, but his son wants to save the whale. Back on shore, the boy's conscience tells him he must at least try to help the animal. He rides the panga back. He dives and cuts the net, dives and cuts, until the whale finally breaks free, reveling with joy. When Abelardo returns to shore his father awaits, hands on hips. With a hug, Papa commends his boy for following his heart to do something foolish yet brave. The first-person narrative balances action and dialogue that are both casual and filled with a gentle gravity. Gerstein's storytelling is simple yet effective. The story provides readers with the right amount of information, allowing them to easily understand the subtleties under the surface of Abelardo's relationship with his father. The mixed-media illustrations are dominated by ocean blues, creamy sun-dappled yellows, and the dignified dark gray whale. Gerstein explores light and shadow in the atmospheric and detailed images grounded in strong compositions and beautiful line work. The specific location remains unnamed; however Abelardo's Spanish name, the characters' brown skin, and the coastal setting point to a Latin American locale. According to the publisher's website, this story was inspired by a real-life video of a whale's rescue.

With this new book, no student of the Bible or Book of Mormon has need to fear. In Understanding Isaiah, the authors break down the otherwise formidable words of Isaiah into small bites that can be absorbed, pondered, and comprehended. Unlike other works on Isaiah, this book goes beyond commentary and actually includes the verses of text comprising not only the King James Version of the Bible but also the Joseph Smith Translation and the Book of Mormon, presenting the most correct translation available today. The text is presented in the same couplet format as it was likely originally written. The authors examine each unit of thought individually, likening it to our modern-day life and presenting definitions and explanations of meaning based on thorough study of the Hebrew language. The result is a comprehensive, accessible reference work that imparts readers an unprecedented understanding of Isaiah. (6&#39; x 9&#39;, 720 pages)</p><p>Donald W.

Drawing heavily from author Wentz&#x2019;s own life, the novel tells the story of Pete, a musician in Chicago who leaves college early to pursue his passion for music. As his band begins to find acclaim, Pete struggles with his difficult relationship with his girlfriend, a woman he knows he loves. Gray does not provide easy answers. Pete openly struggles with depression, anxiety, and substance abuse. He falls into negative behavior patterns, gets out, and then falls back into them again, ultimately attempting to take his own life. In raw and emotional prose, the first-person narrative puts the reader directly inside Pete&#x2019;s mind and in the middle of his struggles to make sense of his relationship with his girlfriend, his blossoming stardom, and his feelings of loss and isolation.

A privileged young man who studied the occult but became a leading proponent of traditional wisdom and arts (eventually converting to the Catholic Faith), Senior, unlike many of even his conservative peers, argued for something more than mere book learning. He championed the full restoration of realism, in which would be brought together the whole man senses, imagination, emotion, will, intellect, and body. Bethel uncovers the roots of Senior&#39;s thought, traces its provocative application, and reveals the possibilities it offers today to an academy wounded by pervasive moral and intellectual relativism, the loss of public credibility, and spiraling costs.</p><p>FRANCIS BETHEL, O.S.B. is a native of Wichita, Kansas.

In 1999 he returned to the United States and was among the founders of the Benedictine monastery of Our Lady of Clear Creek in Hulbert, Oklahoma. Fr.

If you follow its simple prescriptions -- the surprising rules of true financial planning -- you'll live a more relaxed and happier life. You'll do so by achieving a higher and more stable living standard and a better lifestyle.</p><p>These are big claims for a small book. But we aren't offering the revolutionary solution of the moment. This isn't the miracle diet of the week or the sex trick of the month. It isn't even the six mutual funds guaranteed to fix your future. Instead we're providing something with a great pedigree: an economics-based, three-part prescription for personal financial health:</p><p> Maximize your spending power.</p><p> Smooth your living standard.</p><p> Price your love.</p><p>Economists have been developing and refining their approach to financial planning for over a century. But few people know about it, and for good reason: it's been impossible to implement this refined approach from a computational perspective. But times change, and today PCs can calculate in seconds what used to take mainframes weeks. With these new power tools, economists can finally move from describing financial problems to prescribing solutions. In particular, they can now help people improve both their financial and personal lives by finding them a higher, smoother, and more rewarding spending path.</p><p>"Higher, smoother, more rewarding spending" sounds good. So what's the catch?</p><p>There is no catch.</p><p><i>Maximizing your spending power</i> doesn't require working yourself to the bone or even working an extra hour. It means making a host of decisions regarding education, career, job, location, housing, mortgage, retirement account, insurance, portfolio, tax, and Social Security, among others, that provide you more money -- potentially a lot more money -- to spend for the same effort.</p><p>Take the decision of whether to collect a smaller Social Security retirement benefit starting at age sixty-two or a larger one starting at a later age. Making the right choice doesn't take any more time or effort than making the wrong one, but the consequences for your living standard can be spectacular. The same holds for choosing between jobs, mortgages, retirement accounts, and so on.</p><p><i>Smoothing your living standard</i> means spreading your spending power evenly over time, so you never need worry about running out. It doesn't mean starving now to gorge later or vice versa. Economists call this spreading of your spending power over time <i>consumption smoothing</i>. It is based on the law of diminishing returns -- the well known proposition that you <i>can</i> have too much of a good thing. Six-year-olds have this down. Put them in front of a plate of cupcakes. They'll inhale the first, gulp down the second, struggle through thethird, and then save the rest for tomorrow. In making this spending/saving decision, six-year-olds are smoothing their consumption. They are trying to even out their pleasure from consuming today, when times are good (Dad's been shopping), with their pleasure from consuming tomorrow, when times are bad (Mom's going shopping).</p><p>Smoothing your consumption also means protecting your living standard -- making sure it stays relatively steady in good and bad times. For six-year-olds, living-standard protection means hiding the remaining cupcakes from Mom. For us grown-ups, it means inoculating our living standard against adverse changes in income, healthcare costs, taxes, government benefits, and inflation, and making sure that risky investments are truly worth the gamble.</p><p><i>Pricing love</i> doesn't mean selling your firstborn for ready cash. It means knowing what it costs, measured in terms of your living standard, to do things that you'd really love to do. These include taking a wonderful but low-paying job, retiring early, having kids, buying a vacation home, getting divorced, signing up for an Alaska cruise, moving to Arizona, and contributing to charity, among many other things.</p><p>Pricing your passions is critical to getting the most out of your spending power. Imagine having to buy the week's groceries at a market that doesn't post prices. You'd surely end up spending too much on things you thought were cheap but were actually expensive, and perhaps too little on things you thought were expensive but were actually cheap. You'd be spending blind and buying too little love for your money.</p><p><i>Maximize your spending power; smooth your living standard; price your love</i> -- these are the Three Commandments of economics. Although the economics lingo may be foreign, the concepts are familiar. We all try to follow these rules most of the time. Just consider the kinds of financial questions we ask:</p><p> Does contributing to my 401(k) pay?</p><p> Is this mortgage the cheapest?</p><p> Should I go back to school?</p><p> Should I convert my IRA (Individual Retirement Account) to a Roth IRA?</p><p> Am I saving enough to sustain my living standard?</p><p> Will my kids suffer financially if I die?</p><p> Does holding stock make sense at my age?</p><p> Can I afford a cabin cruiser?</p><p> Is working until sixty-five worth it?</p><p> Can I swing living downtown?</p><p> What's a safe rate of retirement spending?</p><p>Each of these questions tests compliance with the Three Commandments. Each involves economics' bottom line: your living standard. And each is a version of: Can I raise my living standard? Can I preserve my living standard? Can I sacrifice my living standard?</p><p>Posing living-standard questions is easy. Answering them is tough. Take contributing to a regular 401(k) versus a Roth 401(k). The former option means paying less tax now but more later. The latter means the opposite. Which option generates a higher living standard? And how do these choices compare if taxes are increased later on?</p><p>Getting the right answer to these seemingly straightforward questions is immensely complicated. But thanks to new economics technology -- technology that calculates your highest sustainable living standard -- such questions can now be answered in seconds.</p><p>This book is going to use this new technology to teach you the Three Commandments. It's going to do so in general and specific terms. And it's going to do so in plain English. So even though one of us -- Larry -- is an economist, there won't be any geek talk or equations, just the repeated application of economic commonsense.</p><p>Economic common sense, you'll come to see, is at complete odds with conventional financial planning, which, frankly, has as much connection to proper saving, insurance, and investment decisions as French fries with melted cheese have to a healthy diet. Indeed, this book will argue that virtually every bit of conventional financial wisdom you've heard over the years is simply wrong.</p><p>So get ready. This book is going to turn your financial thinking upside down. Here's a sample of some of the financial mind-benders you'll shortly encounter -- and understand:</p><p> Setting retirement spending targets is asking for big trouble.</p><p> The poor and middle class should hold relatively more stock than the rich.</p><p> Diversifying your portfolio is generally a bad idea.</p><p> Stock holdings should rise, fall, rise, and fall again with age.</p><p> Having children may lower your need for life insurance.</p><p> Spouses/partners with the highest earnings may need the least life insurance.</p><p> The rich have bigger saving and insurance problems than average people.</p><p> Maximizing retirement account contributions is generally undesirable.</p><p> Waiting to take Social Security can dramatically raise your living standard.</p><p> Oversaving and overinsuring are risky.</p><p> Mortgages offer no tax advantages for most households.</p><p>How Come?</p><p>This book is full of practical steps to improve your financial life. Most of these steps, ironically, have nothing to do with investing in stocks or bonds. Indeed, we don't get to portfolios until part 5. But this book is far more than just a "how-to" financial formulary. It also implants a wee bit of economic theory in your cranium to help you understand economics-based financial planning. Also, expect to get a sense of the computational challenges inherent in proper planning. Once you do, you will realize the primitive nature of conventional planning tools and why it's taken economists so long to develop useful software.</p><p>Finally, get ready for a sobering survey, spiced with gallows humor, of financial pathology American style -- a survey that will leave no doubt: <i>Homo Americanus</i> is not <i>Homo economicus</i>. Americans have personalities, feelings, desires, cravings, appetites, crazes, addictions -- you name it -- none of which enters standard economic theory. To the contrary, standard economic theory presumes that we are super-rational automatons who never crack a smile, never grab a kiss, never get angry, never suffer a lapse in financial judgment, and never get an urgent need to shop till we drop. But, as we'll discuss, <i>neuroeconomics</i> -- the new economics subfield that uses brain waves to study economic choices -- shows that our emotions are fully engaged when we make financial decisions.</p><p>This is not to denigrate the ability of standard economic theory to predict general financial behavior. A great deal of such behavior lines up well with theoretical predictions. For example, the theory predicts that people will save for retirement -- and most people do. But when it comes down to comparing what any given household should do with what that household is actually doing, the gulf is huge. For example, household A should be saving 5 percent of its income, not 20 percent. Household B needs life insurance and is holding $500K, but really needs $1.5 million. Household A should diversify its financial assets and is holding 30 percent stock and 70 percent bonds, but the portfolio shares should be reversed. In other words, most of us try to do the right thing, but we often miss the target -- badly.</p><p>The huge gulf between actual and prescribed behavior tells us we need help in determining and implementing precise economics-based, household-specific recommendations.</p><p>Our survey of Americans' financial ills w...</p></p><h2>The Legend of Ragnar Lothbrok: Viking King and Warrior</h2><p>Millions love the hit television show Vikings-but how many fans know that its main character, Ragnar, is based on an actual Viking king whose ambitious and terrifying exploits have been legend since the ninth century Ad?

The meaning of the business process diagram is the same, regardless of the tool used to create it.&nbsp; But creating models that are correct, complete, and clear demands more than a dictionary of BPMN shapes and symbols. It also requires a methodology for translating process logic consistently into the diagram. And it requires a measure of modeling style as well, conventions that ensure that the process logic is unambiguous from the diagram by itself. In short, "good BPMN" requires a disciplined approach called "method and style."<br><br>In this book, Bruce Silver explains which BPMN elements process modelers need to understand, in two levels, including exactly where and how to use each element. Level 1 (the Descriptive modeling subclass of BPMN 2.0) is a palette of shapes and symbols largely carried over from traditional flowcharting.&nbsp; Level 2 (the Analytic subclass) expands the palette to be able to describe event-triggered behavior, critical to modeling exception handling.<br><br>The book explains the real meaning of BPMN's most basic concepts - like activity, process, and end state - essential to using the language correctly, and provides a step-by-step methodology for going from a blank page to a complete end-to-end BPMN model, developed from the top down in a hierarchical structure.&nbsp; From the top-level diagram you can see on a single page exactly how the process starts, its possible end states, what the instance represents, and communications with the Customer, service providers, and other processes.&nbsp; From there you can drill down to see the details of any part of the process. <br><br>Thie popular first edition of this book was published in 2009 based on the draft BPMN 2.0 specification.&nbsp; This second edition is based on the final BPMN 2.0 specification.&nbsp; Although the diagram elements have changed little since the first edition, both the methodology and style sections have been completely rewritten.<br><br>The second half of the book, the BPMN Implementer's Guide, is completely new.&nbsp; It puts the focus on the XML serialization of the diagram, for both non-executable and executable process models.&nbsp; It details the BPMN 2.0 metamodel and XML Schema, and describes the BPMN-I Profile, a set of serialization rules that facilitate interchange of BPMN models in the Analytic subclass between tools.&nbsp; It also explains how BPMN 2.0 describes execution-related details, such as process data and data mapping, services, messages, and human task assignment, illustrated with an example executable process created in Bonita Open Solution.&nbsp; It concludes with guidelines for implementers on how to align executable design with business-oriented top-down process modeling.<br><br>The book is lavishly illustrated with over 100 BPMN diagrams, and the BPMN Implementer's Guide section contains many XML examples as well.</p><p>Although BPMN is widely accepted as the language of choice for business process diagrams, few process modelers know how to use it correctly or effectively. &nbsp;This book shows you how.&nbsp; It explains the shapes and symbols you need to know, and which ones you can ignore.&nbsp; It provides a prescriptive, top-down methodology for turning a blank page into a complete process model.&nbsp; And it explains the elements of BPMN style, principles of composition that make your models not only correct per the BPMN 2.0 specification but easily understood without reference to attached documentation.&nbsp; The Method and Style approach allows BPMN models to be shared across the business, or between business and IT, revealing the process logic consistently and unambiguously from the diagram alone.<br> &nbsp;<br> The second half of the book, the BPMN Implementer's Guide, is addressed to developers and BPMN tool vendors.&nbsp; It explains the XML underneath the shapes and symbols, including the BPMN 2.0 metamodel and schema, the Descriptive and Analytic Process Modeling Conformance subclasses, and the BPMN-I Profile for interoperability between tools.&nbsp; Few tools serialize BPMN correctly, but the Implementer's Guide shows you how, both for non-executable and executable process models.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Method and Style section is completely rewritten from the first edition, incorporating feedback from hundreds of students in BPMN training.&nbsp; The BPMN Implementer's Guide is brand new in the Second Edition.Bruce Silver is founder and principal of BPMessentials, the leading provider of BPMN training and certification.&nbsp; He has been providing BPMN training since early 2007 and is regarded as an authority in the field.&nbsp; He was a member of the BPMN 2.0 technical committee in OMG, and his BPMS Watch website (brsilver.com) is a popular source of news and commentary about all matters related to BPMN and BPM Suites.</p><h2>Raising Dragons Graphic Novel</h2><p>Graphic novel based on the bestselling book Raising Dragons.

Strong, silent types are everywhere, and it is their telltale silence that has kept their problems hidden until now. A silent son can come from a family that coped with violence, alcoholism, child abuse, extreme rigidity, or divorce, but all silent sons have certain common characteristics: <br> <ul> <li>They keep things that bother them to themselves. <br> </li><li>They deny that unpleasant events occur. <br> </li><li>They fear letting people know them. <br> </li><li>They have difficulty interacting with their parents, spouses, or children. <br> </li><li>They have a strong fear of criticism. <br> </li><li>They are often angry. </li></ul> <br> In <i>Silent Sons,</i> Dr. Robert Ackerman, a silent son himself, examines the problems that commonly confront silent sons, keeping them from experiencing the full range of human emotions. In a compassionate and hopeful voice, the author defines the silent son and examines the impact of parents, particularly fathers, on these men and shows how their dysfunctional upbringing affects their present relationships, especially with women. <br> By putting aside anger, finding peace with one's self, and looking for support from other silent sons, Dr. Ackerman feels every man can realize his full potential and become a well balanced, healthy survivor.</p><p>Dr. Robert J.

The material presented in this book is so compelling that it has turned diehard skeptics into believers.My journey into this realm has been eye opening, mind expanding, and very healing. It is my intention that others will be comforted by the overwhelming evidence of life after death for animals; the highly substantiated notion that our loved ones never really die, no matter their species, no matter their size. &#x2014; Kim Sheridan</p><h2>Torah Queeries: Weekly Commentaries on the Hebrew Bible</h2><p><p>In the Jewish tradition, reading of the Torah follows a calendar cycle, with a specific portion assigned each week. Following on this ancient tradition, Torah Queeries brings together some of the world&#x2019;s leading rabbis, scholars, and writers to interpret the Torah through a &#x201c;bent lens.&#x201d; This incredibly rich collection unites the voices of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and straight-allied writers, including some of the most central figures in contemporary American Judaism. All bring to the table unique methods of reading and interpreting that allow the Torah to speak to modern concerns of sexuality, identity, gender, and LGBT life. Torah Queeries offers cultural critique, social commentary, and a vision of community transformation, all done through biblical interpretation. Written to engage readers, draw them in, and at times provoke them, Torah Queeries charts a future of inclusion and social justice deeply rooted in the Jewish textual tradition.</p><p>A labor of intellectual rigor, social justice, and personal passions, Torah Queeries is an exciting and important contribution to the project of democratizing Jewish communities, and an essential guide to understanding the intersection of queerness and Jewishness.</p></p><p><b>Gregg Drinkwater</b> is Director for Special Projects at Keshet, an organization working for the full inclusion of LGBT Jews in Jewish life.<br><br><b>Joshua Lesser</b> is the rabbi of Bet Haverim in Atlanta, Georgia, and the founder of the Rainbow Center: A Jewish Response to LGBT people and their families.<br><br><b>Judith Plaskow</b> is Professor Emerita of Religious Studies at Manhattan College.<br><br><b>David Shneer</b> is Director of the Program in Jewish Studies and Associate Professor of History at the University of Colorado at Boulder."The tone of the commentaries varies greatly: some are scholarly treatises drawing heavily on rabbinic sources, some are sociological or biological studies, while others are deeply moving personal essays.

The analyses offered here work to break boundaries, queer-ing, celebrating, and re-creating our Jewish texts and traditions in meaningful ways. These acts of reading become the radical movement of making a space for GLBT Jews that is clever, humorous, loving, and thought-provoking." (Rabbi Sharon Kleinbaum,Congregation Beth Simchat Torah, New York)<br><br>"This unique and lively work blends the traditional Jewish format of dividing Torah into weekly portions with specifically queer perspectives on them.

(<i>Jewish Currents</i>)<br><br>"While the CJM invites artists to interpret the weeks Torah portions, Torah Queeries invites LGBT individuals and allies to do so. Both should be celebrated and embraced for their creativity, innovation, and depth."

In these volumes, we find Ripley ensconced on a French estate with a wealthy wife, a world-class art collection, and a past to hide. In <em>Ripley Under Ground</em> (1970), an art forgery goes awry and Ripley is threatened with exposure; in <em>The Boy Who Followed Ripley</em> (1980), Highsmith explores Ripley's bizarrely paternal relationship with a troubled young runaway, whose abduction draws them into Berlin's seamy underworld; and in <em>Ripley Under Water</em> (1991), Ripley is confronted by a snooping American couple obsessed with the disappearance of an art collector who visited Ripley years before. More than any other American literary character, Ripley provides "a lens to peer into the sinister machinations of human behavior" (John Freeman, <em>Pittsburgh Gazette</em>).</p><p>For more than four decades, Patricia Highsmith has developed her unique mastery of suspense - not least in her renowned cycle of novels featuring Tom Ripley. Now, with the fifth in that series and her first new novel in five years, she demonstrates yet again her ability, as Graham Greene wrote, &#34;to create a world of her own, a world claustrophobic and irrational which we enter each time with a sense of personal danger&#34;. Though his talent for evil has in no way diminished, Tom Ripley has aged, even mellowed. Now leading the good life in the French countryside, complete with chic wife and devoted housekeeper, he is more interested in his wine stores than the bloodstains on the cellar floor. Then a meddlesome American couple takes up residence in the same village. Though at first the Pritchards seem a mere curiosity, their taste as execrable as their manners, they are annoyingly well informed about incidents in Ripley&#39;s past and almost smug about flaunting their knowledge. This, of course, disturbs the tranquillity of the charmed, cultured life for which Tom has worked so hard, and he has no choice but to bedevil the Pritchards in return. Thus begins a spirited, sophisticated game of cat and mouse that leads to Tangier and London and back again, to the pond behind the Pritchards&#39; house. It is Ripley at his most suave and devious - and Patricia Highsmith in peak form. For her aficionados, Ripley Under Water is utterly essential - and for readers new to her work, a spectacular introduction to &#34;a natural novelist&#34; (John Gross, The New York Times).Tom Ripley passes his leisured days at his French country estate tending the dahlias, practicing the harpsichord, and enjoying the company of his lovely wife, Heloise. Never mind the bloodstains on the basement floor. <br>But some new neighbors have moved to Villeperce: the Pritchards, just arrived from America. they are a ghastly pair, with vulgar manners and even more vulgar taste. Most inconvenient, though, is their curiosity. Ripley does, after all, have a few things to hide. When menacing coincidences begin to occur, a spiraling contest of sinister hints and mutual terrorism ensues, resulting in one of Patricia Highsmith's most elegantly harrowing novels to date.</p><h2>The Cuba Reader: History, Culture, Politics (The Latin America Readers)</h2><p>Tracking Cuban history from 1492 to the present, <i>The Cuba Reader</i> includes more than one hundred selections that present myriad perspectives on Cuba's history, culture, and politics.

But when they discover a Sleeping Princess at the centre of a maze, astonishing things begin to happen. Amongst a horde of jewels they discover a ring that grants wishes. But wishes granted are not always wishes wanted, so the children find themselves grappling with invisibility, dinosaurs, a ghost and the fearsome Ugli-Wuglies before it is all resolved. This edition of The Enchanted Castle has forty-seven evocative illustrations by H.R. Millar</p><p>A plot summary makes this story sound ordinary by children's literature standards: the summer adventures of four children who discover an enchanted castle and a magic ring. But Edith Nesbit's adored classic (written in 1907) is so much more than the description suggests. Right from the start, the author plays with the idea of magic, teasing us with a sleeping princess who turns out to be a fake. Elsewhere, the magic is "real" as can be--in fact, though written nearly 100 years ago, <i>The Enchanted Castle</i> prefigures the magical realism of modern novels in the matter-of-fact way it weaves the uncanny into the children's everyday life. And, while few authors are confident enough to parody bad writing, Nesbit does it hilariously (and ever so gently) through one character's tendency to "talk like a book": "'To brush his hair and his clothes... was to our hero but the work of a moment,' said Gerald." Things turn scary when the Ugly Wuglies, fake people made from painted cardboard masks, old clothes, and broomsticks, come to life. But on the whole this book about enchantment--much praised by such luminaries as H.G. Wells and Noel Coward--is, simply, enchanting. (Ages 6 and older) <i>--Richard Farr</i>Edith Nesbit (1858-1924) was the author of a number of much-loved stories in which ordinary children encounter magical adventures in the everyday world. Her novels include the three-book series <i> Five Children and It, The Phoenix and the Carpet, </i> and <i> The Story of the Amulet. </i> Her other books include <i> The Enchanted Castle</i></p><h2>Elfquest: The Final Quest Volume 2</h2><p>It is time.

She lives in Palm Desert, California.1<br><br> OT twenty minutes has passed since you left me here in the caf�, since I said No to your request, that I would never write out for you the story of my mortal life, how I became a vampire&#x2014;how I came upon Marius only years after he had lost his human life.<br><br>Now here I am with your notebook open, using one of the sharp pointed eternal ink pens you left me, delighted at the sensuous press of the black ink into the expensive and flawless white paper.<br><br>Naturally, David, you would leave me something elegant, an inviting page. This notebook bound in dark varnished leather, is it not, tooled with a design of rich roses, thornless, yet leafy, a design that means only Design in the final analysis but bespeaks an authority. What is written beneath this heavy and handsome book cover will count, sayeth this cover.<br><br>The thick pages are ruled in light blue&#x2014;you are practical, so thoughtful, and you probably know I almost never put pen to paper to write anything at all.<br><br>Even the sound of the pen has its allure, the sharp scratch rather like the finest quills in ancient Rome when I would put them to parchment to write my letters to my Father, when I would write in a diary my own laments . . . ah, that sound. The only thing missing here is the smell of ink, but we have the fine plastic pen which will not run out for volumes, making as fine and deep a black mark as I choose to make.<br><br>I am thinking about your request in writing. You see you will get something from me. I find myself yielding to it, almost as one of our human victims yields to us, discovering perhaps as the rain continues to fall outside, as the caf� continues with its noisy chatter, to think that this might not be the agony I presumed&#x2014;reaching back over the two thousand years&#x2014;but almost a pleasure, like the act of drinking blood itself.<br><br>I reach now for a victim who is not easy for me to overcome: my own past. Perhaps this victim will flee from me with a speed that equals my own. Whatever, I seek now a victim that I have never faced. And there is the thrill of the hunt in it, what the modern world calls investigation.<br><br>Why else would I see those times so vividly now? You had no magic potion to give me to loosen my thoughts. There is but one potion for us and it is blood.<br><br>You said at one point as we walked towards the caf�, &#x201c;You will remember everything.&#x201d;<br><br>You, who are so young amongst us yet were so old as a mortal, and such a scholar as a mortal. Perhaps it is natural that you so boldly attempt to collect our stories.<br><br>But why seek to explain here such curiosity as yours, such bravery in face of blood-drenched truth?<br><br>How could you have kindled in me this longing to go back, two thousand years, almost exactly&#x2014; to tell of my mortal days on Earth in Rome, and how I joined Marius, and what little chance he had against Fate.<br><br>How could origins so deeply buried and so long denied suddenly beckon to me. A door snaps open. A light shines. Come in.<br><br>I sit back now in the caf�.<br><br>I write, but I pause and look around me at the people of this Paris caf�. I see the drab unisex fabrics of this age, the fresh American girl in her olive green military clothes, all of her possessions slung over her shoulder in a backpack; I see the old Frenchman who has come here for decades merely to look at the bare legs and arms of the young, to feed on the gestures as if he were a vampire, to wait for some exotic jewel of a moment when a woman sits back laughing, cigarette in hand, and the cloth of her synthetic blouse becomes tight over her breasts and there the nipples are visible.<br><br>Ah, old man. He is gray-haired and wears an expensive coat. He is no menace to anyone. He lives entirely in vision. Tonight he will go back to a modest but elegant apartment which he has maintained since the last Great World War, and he will watch films of the young beauty Brigitte Bardot. He lives in his eyes. He has not touched a woman in ten years.<br><br>I don&#x2019;t drift, David. I drop anchor here. For I will not have my story pour forth as from a drunken oracle.<br><br>I see these mortals in a more attentive light. They are so fresh, so exotic and yet so luscious to me, these mortals; they look like tropical birds must have looked when I was a child; so full of fluttering, rebellious life, I wanted to clutch them to have it, to make their wings flap in my hands, to capture flight and own it and partake of it. Ah, that terrible moment in childhood when one accidentally crushes the life from a bright-red bird.<br><br>Yet they are sinister in their darker vestments, some of these mortals: the inevitable cocaine dealer&#x2014;and they are everywhere, our finest prey&#x2014;who waits for his contact in the far corner, his long leather coat styled by a noted Italian designer, his hair shaved close on the side and left bushy on the top to make him look distinctive, which it does, though there is no need when one considers his huge black eyes, and the hardness of what nature intended to be a generous mouth. He makes those quick impatient gestures with his cigarette lighter on the small marble table, the mark of the addicted; he twists, he turns, he cannot be comfortable. He doesn&#x2019;t know that he will never be comfortable in life again. He wants to leave to snort the cocaine for which he burns and yet he must wait for the contact. His shoes are too shiny, and his long thin hands will never grow old.<br><br>I think he will die tonight, this man. I feel a slow gathering desire to kill him myself. He has fed so much poison to so many. Tracking him, wrapping him in my arms, I would not even have to wreathe him with visions. I would let him know that death has come in the form of a woman too white to be human, too smoothed by the centuries to be anything but a statue come to life. But those for whom he waits plot to kill him. And why should I intervene?<br><br>What do I look like to these people? A woman with long wavy clean brown hair that covers me much like a nun&#x2019;s mantle, a face so white it appears cosmetically created, and eyes, abnormally brilliant, even from behind golden glasses.<br><br>Ah, we have a lot to be grateful for in the many styles of eyeglasses in this age&#x2014;for if I were to take these off, I should have to keep my head bowed, not to startle people with the mere play of yellow and brown and gold in my eyes, that have grown ever more jewel-like over the centuries, so that I seem a blind woman set with topaz for her pupils, or rather carefully formed orbs of topaz, sapphire, even aquamarine.<br><br>Look, I have filled so many pages, and all I am saying is Yes, I will tell you how it began for me.<br><br>Yes, I will tell you the story of my mortal life in ancient Rome, how I came to love Marius and how we came to be together and then to part.<br><br>What a transformation in me, this resolution.<br><br>How powerful I feel as I hold this pen, and how eager to put us in sharp and clear perspective before I begin fulfilling your request.<br><br>This is Paris, in a time of peace. There is rain. High regal gray buildings with their double windows and iron balconies line this boulevard. Loud, tiny, dangerous automobiles race in the streets. Caf�s, such as this, are overflowing with international tour- ists. Ancient churches are crowded here by tenements, palaces turned to museums, in whose rooms I linger for hours gazing at objects from Egypt or Sumer which are even older than me. Roman architecture is everywhere, absolute replicas of Temples of my time now serve as banks. The words of my native Latin suffuse the English language. Ovid, my beloved Ovid, the poet who predicted his poetry would outlast the Roman Empire, has been proved true.<br><br>Walk into any bookstore and you find him in neat, small paperbacks, designed to appeal to students.<br><br>Roman influence seeds itself, sprouting mighty oaks right through the modern forest of computers, digital disks, microviruses and space satellites.<br><br>It is easy here&#x2014;as always&#x2014;to find an embraceable evil, a despair worth tender fulfillment.<br><br>And with me there must always be some love of the victim, some mercy, some self-delusion that the death I bring does not mar the great shroud of inevitability, woven of trees and earth and stars, and human events, which hovers forever around us ready to close on all that is created, all that we know.<br><br>Last night, when you found me, how did it seem to you? I was alone on the bridge over the Seine, walking in the last dangerous darkness before dawn.<br><br>You saw me before I knew you were there. My hood was down and I let my eyes in the dim light of the bridge have their little moment of glory. My victim stood at the railing, no more than a child, but bruised and robbed by a hundred men. She wanted to die in the water. I don&#x2019;t know if the Seine is deep enough for one to drown there. So near the Ile St.-Louis. So near Notre Dame. Perhaps it is, if one can resist a last struggle for life.<br><br>But I felt this victim&#x2019;s soul like ashes, as though her spirit had been cremated and only the body remained, a worn, disease-ridden shell. I put my arm around her, and when I saw the fear in her small black eyes, when I saw the question coming, I wreathed her with images. The soot that covered my skin was not enough to keep me from looking like the Virgin Mary, and she sank into hymns and devotion, she even saw my veils in the colors she had known in churches of childhood, as she yielded to me, and I&#x2014;knowing that I needn&#x2019;t drink, but thirsting for her, thirsting for the anguish she could give forth in her final moment, thirsting for the tasty red blood that would fill my mouth and make me feel human for one instant in my very monstrosity&#x2014;I gave in to her visions, bent her neck, ran my fingers over her sore tender skin, and then it was, when I sank my teeth into her, when I drank from her&#x2014;it was then that I knew you were there. You watched.<br><br>I knew it, and I felt it, and I saw the image of us in your eye, distractingly, as the pleasure nevertheless flushed through me, making me believe I was alive, somehow connected to fields of clover or trees with roots deeper in the earth than the branches they raise to the welkin above.<br><br>At first I hated you. You saw me as I feasted. You saw me as I gave in. You knew nothing of my months of starvation, restraint, wandering. You saw only the sudden release of my unclean desire to suck her very soul from her, to make her heart rise in the flesh inside her, to drag from her veins every precious particle of her that still wanted to survive.<br><br>And she did want to survive. Wrapped in saints, and dreaming suddenly of the breasts that nursed her, her young body fought, pumping and pumping against me, she so soft, and my own form hard as a statue, my milkless nipples enshrined in marble, no comfort. Let her see her mother, dead, gone and now waiting. Let me glimpse through her dying eyes the light through which she sped towards this certain salvation.<br><br>Then I forgot about you. I would not be robbed. I slowed the drinking, I let her sigh, I let her lungs fill with the cold river air, her mother drawing closer and closer so that death now was as safe for her as the womb. I took every drop from her that she could give.</p><h2>Kinsey and Me: Stories</h2><p><strong>From the #1 <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author of the acclaimed Alphabet series comes a collection of stories that &#x201c;combines glimpses of her series detective, Kinsey Millhone, with a revealing self-portrait&#x201d; (<em>Publishers Weekly</em>).</strong><br><br>In 1982, Sue Grafton introduced Kinsey Millhone and created an iconic female detective.

Soon after, both writer and heroine became icons and international bestsellers. Ms. Grafton was a writer who consistently broke the bonds of genre while never writing the same book twice. Named a Grand Master by the Mystery Writers of America, her awards and honors included the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Private Eye Writers of America, the Ross Macdonald Literary Award, the Cartier Diamond Dagger Award from Britain's Crime Writers' Association, the Lifetime Achievement Award from Malice Domestic, a Lifetime Achievement Award from Bouchercon, three Shamus Awards, and three Anthony Awards&#x2014;including the first two ever awarded.

Breggin, MD. In a bold new approach to the lives of our Founders and the principles they embraced, this book shows how the same ideals that inspired the American Revolution and the Declaration of Independence can motivate and guide us to live happier and more satisfying lives. &#x201c;Wow, I'm an American!&#x201d; demonstrates for the first time how the Founding principles of freedom, responsibility, gratitude, and love apply not only to government policy but also to the everyday challenges in our personal lives. At a time when the Constitution and traditional American values are threatened as never before, &#x201c;Wow, I'm an American!&#x201d; revitalizes the American spirit. Founders like George Washington, John and Abigail Adams, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, Samuel Adams, James Madison and Benjamin Rush built this country&#x2019;s government and their personal lives around the &#x201c;inalienable rights&#x201d; to life, liberty, property, and the pursuit of happiness. Our great political documents like the Bill of Rights express the integrity of their overall approach to life. No other book so imaginatively captures the essence of what makes America great, while showing us how to apply these principles to everyday living. Written in the spirit that simplicity is the test of truth and usefulness, Dr. Breggin's words can help the entire family to understand and to live like our Founding heroes. ... WILLIAM GLASSER, MD, PSYCHIATRIST AND AUTHOR: "Takes a fresh new approach to American history that will give you a deeper appreciation of the people who founded our nation and how to apply their beliefs to your everyday life." ... BARRY STRAUSS, PH.D., CORNELL UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR OF HISTORY: "As a historian, I admire Peter Breggin's insight into the American past. If you want one book that explains for the whole family what America is all about, look no further." ... CHRISTOPHER HARPER, TEMPLE UNIVERSITY ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF JOURNALISM AND FORMER WASHINGTON CORRESPOND FOR NEWSWEEK: &#x201c;Peter Breggin&#x2019;s book describes the magic and majesty of what the founders did for us. An inspiring book that my family, including my 16-year-old daughter, enjoyed.&#x201d;</p><p></p><h2>The Art of Finger Dexterity, Op. 740 (Complete) (Alfred Masterwork Edition)</h2><p>These 50 excellent and systematic exercises Czerny devised for developing finger dexterity are as useful today as when they were first written.

Reading this will be like having him walk me through the history of the war like a personal guide. -- Kate Mosse The heart of Beevor&#39;s appeal is precisely that straightforward narrative approach, coupled with his lively, engaging style and his use of memorable, almost cinematic, set-pieces. * HISTORY TODAY * the whole story told in the author&#39;s usual erudite yet highly readable prose * DESPATCHES Magazine * A magnificent performance - true excitement from one page to the next delivered in faultless prose. -- Christoper Silvester * DAILY EXPRESS * The book could not really have been done better. * MILITARY HISTORY MONTHLY * Beevor is excellent at catching the individual in the flood-tide of events. -- John Lewis-Stempel * SUNDAY EXPRESS * This is history writ large. -- James Owen * THE SUNDAY TELEGRAPH magazine * This is the place to begin if you need to get your knowledge of the war in order. -- Hew Strachan * EVENING STANDARD * remarkably well-written and informative -- Norman Stone * LITERARY REVIEW * The book that Beevor has been building towards writing - and everybody else has been anticipating reading. -- Donal O&#39;Donoghue * RTE GUIDE * This is as comprehensive and objective an account of the course of the war as we are likely to get, and the most humanly moving to date. -- John Gray * NEW STATESMAN * Everyone who is interested in the Second World War should read this book. -- Laurence Rees * WW2HISTORY.COM * Beevor&#39;s book is a pleasure to read and an example of intelligent, lively historical writing at its best. -- Tony Barber * THE FINANCIAL TIMES * This is a splendid book, erudite, with an admirable clarity of thought and expression. -- Roger Moorhouse * THE INDEPENDENT ON SUNDAY * The myriad pieces of this intricate kaleidoscope are pieced together with exemplary skill. -- Roger Moorhouse * THE INDEPENDENT ON SUNDAY * Brocaded with details of the great campaigns and thoughtful explanations of Hitler&#39;s murderous belligerence, The Second World War is an absorbing, unsparingly lucid work of military history. -- Ian Thomson * THE SPECTATOR * You feel yourself being carried along on the narrative flow, channelled this way and that through the pools and rapids by Beevor&#39;s expert helmanship. -- Patrick Bishop * STANDPOINT * If you want to understand the war as military struggle, this book is all you really need.

When it happens, it can place great strain on a marriage, as well as on other relationships.

In this book, Nancy and David Guthrie explore the family dynamics involved when a loved one dies&#x2015;and debunk some myths about family grief. Through their own experiences of losing two young children and interviews with those who've faced losing spouses and parents, they show how grief can actually pull a family closer together rather than tearing it apart.</p><p><p>Someone's missing. </p><p> When your family's lost a loved one, the reminders are everywhere.

Yet many equally unconventional but less well known aspects of Berkshire&#x2019;s managerial practices and organizational structure are rich with lessons for those seeking to follow in Buffett&#x2019;s footsteps. <i>Margin of Trust</i> is the first book to distill Buffett&#x2019;s approach to management and corporate life. It provides a definitive analysis of the tenets of the Berkshire system, its costs and benefits, and how it can be adapted for other organizations.<br><br>Lawrence A. Cunningham and Stephanie Cuba develop a new account of how Berkshire Hathaway works, showing that the key to its success is trust. Profiling partnership practices and business methods, they contend that Berkshire&#x2019;s distinguishing feature is a culture in which autonomy and decentralization are core management principles. Cunningham and Cuba provide instructive examples of how this model has been successfully adapted by other companies that share a faith in trust as an organizing principle. They also offer candid commentary on the risks of a trust-based approach and how to mitigate them. <i>Margin of Trust</i> features illuminating analysis of Buffett&#x2019;s take on the role trust plays in business agreements, what Buffett looks for in great corporate boards, and what lies ahead for Berkshire after its iconic leader leaves the scene.</p><p>Lawrence A.

But despite her international fame and her tireless efforts on behalf of UNICEF,&nbsp;Audrey was also known for her intense privacy. With unprecedented access to studio archives, friends and colleagues who knew and loved Audrey, bestselling author Donald Spoto provides an intimate and moving account of this beautiful, elusive and talented woman.<br><br> Tracing her astonishing rise to stardom, from her harrowing childhood in Nazi-controlled Holland during World War II to her years as a struggling ballet dancer in London and her Tony Award&#x2013;winning Broadway debut in <i>Gigi</i>, Spoto illuminates the origins of Audrey&#x2019;s tenacious spirit and fiercely passionate nature.

They live in Denmark.Chapter One <br><br>= <br><br>1929-1939 <br><br>There had been bright sunshine when they left the English shore, but midway across the Channel, dark clouds swept overhead, and the wind had shifted from breezy to almost gale force. Now, as the ship headed for the Continent, they were suddenly caught in a late-winter storm. Cold rain whipped across the deck and stung their faces as the ferry rolled and pitched. Years later, the baroness could not recall feeling any anxiety during the crossing, and therefore she had not communicated any fear to her two small boys as they steadied themselves against her. <br><br>This squall was far less threatening than the typhoon she had once endured in the South China Sea; nor was it as threatening as the violent conditions that routinely battered the ships that had taken her from Asia to South America or from the Netherlands to the East Indies. Thanks to the composure of the Dutch baroness, her eight- and four-year-old sons could face the heavy weather cheerfully. But if she did not hold their hands tightly, the wind might easily sweep the children overboard. Better to take them inside for hot chocolate. <br><br>On her way to the ferry's caf�, the baroness passed her husband in the small, smoky lounge bar. Warming himself with Irish whiskey, he glanced toward her but did not interrupt his conversation with a fellow passenger. Her husband was not the boys' father-they were sons from her <br>rst marriage. And from his dif<br>dence, no one in the room would have guessed that he had any connection to this handsome, patrician woman and her two docile children. She heard him tell his drinking partner that he had left England to take up a new position in Belgium with great prospects. Indeed, she hoped for the best, for him as for herself and the boys: if at last he could hold a job longer than a month or two without succumbing to indolence-well, that might help secure the marriage, too. He was her second husband, and they had been married for three years; during that entire time, she reckoned that he had not worked a total of three months. <br><br>Her <br>rst husband had jumped from the matrimonial ship <br>ve years after their wedding, which was just four years ago, and she was left with two small boys when she was twenty-<br>ve; now, domestic storm clouds were once again on the horizon. And she was seven months pregnant. <br><br>She had some <br>nancial resources and a share of ancestral property, for her family was of old European aristocracy. And she had a title: she was the Dutch Baroness Ella van Heemstra, now also Mrs. Ruston. Dutch baronesses were not a rare breed even in 1929; most democratic Netherlanders did not mind the last of the noble gentry using venerable titles-but only if their holders adopted no airs and graces and imitated the Dutch royal family, an amiably down-to-earth clan. <br><br>The four travelers reached Brussels safely and proceeded to a rented house. There, with the help of a relative who arrived from Holland, the baroness prepared for the child's birth while her husband went off to his job with a British insurance company as a minor clerk with no con<br>dential duties. He was bored from the <br>rst day. <br><br>On the morning of Saturday, May 4, the baroness went into labor, and by mid-afternoon she was nursing her newborn daughter. "Saturday's child works hard for a living," according to Mother Goose. <br><br>Ella, the Baroness van Heemstra, was born in the fashionable Dutch suburb of Velp, near Arnhem, on June 12, 1900. One of nine children, she was the daughter of Baron Arnoud Jan Adolf van Heemstra (once the governor of Dutch Guiana in South America-later Surinam) and his wife, the Baroness Elbrig Wilhelmine Henrietta van Asbeck; both families were titled aristocrats. The precise reasons for the baronetcies remain unclear, but in each case both sets of Ella's grandparents were respected jurists or judges with a long history of service to Crown and country. Their children, Ella's parents, inherited the titles according to the custom of the time. <br><br>Ella's childhood was not underprivileged: her parents owned a country mansion, a city house and a summer cottage, and they employed a small platoon of servants who attended them everywhere. Photos taken of Ella in her mid-twenties show a strikingly attractive woman with <br>ne features, dark hair, a clear, translucent complexion and a certain digni<br>ed smile, neither girlish, coy nor seductive. She was, in other words, every bit the image of a somewhat Germanic-Victorian aristocrat, and it was, of course, the Germanic-Victorian style (overstuffed in furniture and formal in demeanor) that was the standard all over Europe-if not among the royal families, certainly among their social rivals, the landed gentry. <br><br>At the age of nineteen, Ella concluded a respectable but undemanding upper-class education, at which she excelled mostly in singing and amateur theatricals, to the point where she expressed a desire to become an opera singer. Her parents thought little of that and instead purchased her a <br>rst-class ticket on a long steamship journey to visit relatives who worked for Dutch colonial companies in Batavia-the Latin name for the Netherlands, later Jakarta-in the Dutch East Indies (later Indonesia). <br><br>There Ella blossomed and ourished. Much in demand for her <br>ne voice, which she put to good use entertaining at parties; for her clever repartee and her air of sophistication; and for her genteel irtatiousness, Ella impressed many eligible young men and their parents in the colonies. On March 11, 1920-<br>ve months after her arrival and three months before her twentieth birthday-Ella's parents traveled to Batavia for her marriage to Hendrik Gustaaf Adolf Quarles van Ufford, who was six years her senior and held a respectable job. Business was thriving that year in the Indies, at least partly because at home the Netherlands began to experience a severe depression and relied on the colonies more than ever. <br><br>Van Ufford's mother was a baroness with a respected Dutch and French pedigree, and everything augured well for a happy and pro<br>table union. On December 5 of that same year, Ella bore a son they named Arnoud Robert Alexander Quarles van Ufford (always known as Alex); and on August 27, 1924, they welcomed Ian Edgar Bruce Quarles van Ufford. But things soon went very wrong. When Hendrik returned to the Netherlands at Christmas 1924 to discuss a transfer from Batavia, Ella and the toddlers accompanied him. Early in 1925, she and her husband registered their divorce in Arnhem, for reasons that may forever remain unclear. <br><br>At once, van Ufford took ship for San Francisco, where (he said) he had a good offer of work; there, he soon met and married a German immigrant named Marie Caroline Rohde. With that, Hendrik Quarles van Ufford removed himself from the lives of Ella and their two sons; the public record shows only that he returned to the Netherlands years later, where he died on July 14, 1955, at the age of sixty. <br><br>And so, that spring of 1925, the twenty-four-year-old Baroness Ella van Heemstra van Ufford was left with two babies and no husband. Her friends in Holland noted that she had become somewhat imperious, perhaps from defensiveness about the dissolution of her marriage, but she had a title, a Dutch home with her parents and a nanny for her sons. <br><br>These bene<br>ts notwithstanding, Ella surprised her parents by returning to Batavia, and there she renewed a friendship she had earlier formed with a dashing, courtly Englishman she had met even while her marriage was foundering. Joseph Victor Anthony Ruston, eleven years older than Ella, was born November 21, 1889, in Onzic, Bohemia, where his London-born father, Victor John Ruston, had worked and where he had married a local girl named Anna Catherina Wels. Joseph's maternal grandmother's maiden name was Kathleen Hepburn. <br><br>When Joseph and Ella were reunited that spring of 1926, he was still married to Cornelia Wilhelmina Bisschop, a Dutch woman he had married in the East Indies. They were living entirely on her family inheritance, which was certainly helpful, for Ruston never really had any sort of career-nor much of a desire for one. Later identi<br>ed by Hepburn biographers as an Anglo-Irish banker, he was neither Irish nor a banker; "the sad truth is, he never really hung on to any job," according to one of his grandsons. But he had a calm manner, a handsome expression, dark eyes like velvet (according to Ella's description) and, thanks to Cornelia, a <br>ne wardrobe. He sported a little moustache like an artist's brush, and he photographed well; it was not dif<br>cult to understand his appeal to Ella, who in any case was eager to <br>nd a new father for her boys. <br><br>She had every reason to expect that a man with a good job could be found. The direct rule by the Netherlands over the Dutch East Indies had greatly expanded since 1900, and Dutch strategies to control both the economy and tax revenues meant that virtually every exported item was shipped through Batavia. <br><br>Joseph found Ella cultivated, elegant and as enamored of the good life as he, and they enjoyed attending cotillions, military parades, <br>ne restaurants and sporting events. But Ella's greatest appeal was her title-about which he joked so often that she recognized how seriously he took it. Never mind that the title was a centuries-old honori<br>c used by other ladies in Batavia-and never mind that Ella took an of<br>ce job to support herself and her boys. Joseph, besotted with all things that had a trace of the upper classes, took to introducing her as his friend, the baroness. He understood quite clearly that marriage would not promote him to a baronetcy, yet he greatly valued her background and breeding, and perhaps most of all, he saw her family's afuence as a very comfortable cushion in life-indeed, as a plush settee on which he could, when so inclined, rest and relax. <br><br>Cornelia, meanwhile, apparently complaisant and much on her own, luxuriated in the rare<br>ed precincts of colonial life, with a home lavishly appointed in ivory and gold (common for the white Europeans), and there was no shortage of natives to look after their needs. Daily life among the wealthy could neatly be described in terms of a Somerset Maugham novel: the setting was not a dreary backwater outpost but a rather chic preserve for the few advantaged foreigners who controlled the economy. <br><br>When Joseph said he could obtain a speedy divorce from his wife, Ella accepted his proposal. Fortunately, Cornelia Bisschop Ruston made no objections, for she had romantic interests elsewhere. Papers were drawn up, signed and countersigned on all sides, there was a quick divorce, and on September 7, 1926, Ella and Joseph were married. <br><br>For a brief time, the baroness was attered by her handsome husband, who was at least a presentable escort in society. But she was also alert, and soon she became impatient with his idle and morose comportment. Alas, Joseph Ruston was revealing himself as a common adventurer who had married her for access to her money and the chance to live in the capacious light of her aristocratic family. He made no effort to work for a living, and he seemed to have an excuse when, in November, a Communist revolt caused massive rioting and was put down only with great dif<br>culty. How, he protested, could he go out to work in so unstable a colony? From this time, Joseph Ruston's conversations were peppered with fervent anti-Communist declamations. <br><br>But languor, political tirades and the trivialities of social life were not in Ella's character, and she had no appreciation of those qualities in others, the general public discord notwithstanding. Within a year of the marriage, there were heated arguments about money, Joseph's idleness and his alarming emotional indifference to her two sons. In muted desperation, Ella wrote to her parents, who suggested that Joseph might do well to meet some of their business associates in London. This he agreed to do; he very much missed England in any case, and he considered London far more agreeable than Batavia. Hence, in late 1928, Joseph, Ella, Ian and Alexander took the long journey from the East Indies to Britain. <br><br>They arrived on Christmas Eve and leased a at in fashionable Mayfair, a few steps from Hyde Park. The holiday season, Joseph insisted, was no time to hunt for employment, and so he waited until February. A colleague of his father-in-law then made Joseph an offer of employment at a British insurance company in Belgium, and in mid-March the baroness and her husband again packed their luggage, boarded the storm-swept ferry for France and then proceeded to Brussels by train. <br><br>At the end of May, the newborn baby nearly succumbed to whooping cough. She stopped breathing and began to turn blue, and the nanny froze with panic and called out to Ella, who did not know panic. Adding audible prayers to her procedure of turning, spanking and warming the infant, Ella effectively saved her life. <br><br>On July 18, ten weeks after their daughter was born, Ella and Joseph Ruston registered the birth with the British vice consulate in Brussels, for the law considered the child English by descent from her father. According to the document, she was born at <br><br>48 rue Keyenveld, also called Keienveldstraat, in the Ixelles district, southeast of the center of Brussels. The child's full legal name was Audrey Kathleen Ruston; throughout her life, Audrey carried a British passport. <br><br>After World War II and the death of the last Hepburn relative in Joseph's maternal ancestry, he legally changed his surname to Hepburn-Ruston, which he thought very posh. The Hepburn clan, which may be traced centuries back in Scots-Irish history, had dozens of various orthographies, among them Hebburne, Hyburn and Hopbourn. Among his most notable forebears-or so Joseph said-was James Hepburn, Earl of Bothwell and third husband of Mary, Queen of Scots. But the multiple branches on the Hepburn tree and the doubtful genealogies at several critical junctures render dif<br>cult any positive veri<br>cation of this grand assertion. <br><br>The van Heemstra-Ruston house in Brussels was but one of Audrey's childhood residences. She often spent time with her grandparents at their estates in Arnhem, Holland, and outside Arnhem, at Velp. Ella also often took her to visit cousins, most of all when Joseph was absent. He was frequently dispatched to the <br>nance management company's London of<br>ce, and when he was at home with the family, he often attended political meetings in the city center. <br><br>Whenever he returned home from a day's or a week's business, Joseph was welcomed excitedly by his adoring daughter. But by all accounts, he doted on her no more than he did on Ian and Alex. Ella taught Audrey to read and draw, to enjoy the standard children's classics and good music, and the child longed to show her father what she was learning. But he showed little interest in her, and Audrey's response to his coolness was typical of any child: she redoubled her efforts to win his love and approval-alas, to no avail.</p><h2>Adventures in Odyssey: The Official Guide: A Behind-the-Scenes Look at the World&#39;s Favorite Family Audio Drama (Adventures in Odyssey Books)</h2><p>For more than 20 years, Adventures in Odyssey has delighted kids (and kids at heart!) with exciting stories and character-building truths.

Shipped from the U.K. All orders received before 3pm sent that weekday.</p><p>Born in Kenya in 1955 where he spent his early years, Richard Shirreff commissioned into the British Army as a cavalry officer after reading history at Oxford. In his 37 years of service he commanded soldiers on operations from the most junior to the most senior levels. He saw combat as a tank commander in the First Gulf War, experienced many of the complexities of Northern Ireland during his three tours there and learned first-hand the challenges of bringing peace to the Balkans in both Kosovo and Bosnia. He returned to Iraq as a multinational commander in 2006-7. When not in command he spent time either being educated in the art and science of war on a succession of different command and staff courses or in a range of posts as a formulator or executor of policy in the Ministry of Defence and Army Headquarters. His last seven years in uniform were spent in two senior NATO command posts: Commander of the Allied Rapid Reaction Corps and Deputy Supreme Allied Commander Europe; the Alliance&#39;s deputy strategic commander and the most senior British general in the Alliance. Since leaving the Army he has set up Strategia Worldwide, a risk management consultancy.Rarely has as a figure as senior as Sir Richard Shirreff, dared to put his name to as ominous a contingency history as one pictured in 2017 War With Russia. It can&#39;t happen? Just like the Anschluss of Crimea, or Brexit? Russia is again ruled by one man alone and President Putin has proved capable of gambling with the fate of his country and peace in Europe. In the guise of fast-paced novel, General Shirreff shows how it could actually be done: the disinformation, the subversion, the order of battle. And how woefully unprepared the free world would be to stand up to such a challenge. His warning should be read not only by anyone interested in fate of the West but, above all, by politicians whose decisions on defence determine our options in future emergencies. * Radoslaw Sikorski * The authenticity of the high-level crisis talks withing Nato which Shirreff attended in his past life, is so palpable that it lands this book like a 22lb bass. This and the foreword are reasons enough to buy a copy. * The Express * NATO must bolster its military presence in the Baltic states or risk nuclear war, a former general has warned. * Moscow Times * Is Britain headed for nuclear war with Russia NEXT YEAR? Former top Nato official predicts massive global conflict will break out in 2017. * The Sun * West and Russia on course for war. -- Ewen MacAskill, Defence Correspondent * The Guardian * On the brink of WW3? Top NATO official predicts massive global conflict NEXT YEAR. -- Tom Evans * Daily Star * Make no mistake: if Russia marches into the Baltics it means nuclear war. -- Damian Whitworth * The Times * This piece of &#34;faction&#34; is billed as an urgent warning - it&#39;s also an act of near mutiny. -- Michael Burleigh * The Times * The evil gloating trope is much in evidence in General Sir Richard Shirreff&#39;s 2017: War With Russia...a pacy techno-thriller and a clarion call to the West. -- Shashank Joshi * Financial Times * We sit on our hands while busy fingers in the East boot up for cyber-war. -- Max Hastings * The Sunday Times * A must read...Shirreff&#39;s warnings - veiled as fiction - ring with authenticity, rich in technical details and insight. * General Wesley K. Clark, US Army, former Supreme Allied Commander Europe * The great strength of this tale is that it is told by an insider who really knows. The moral of this story is clear. The relentless hollowing out of the military and defence postures of the west have placed us all in danger. This is a parable with a real message about our general ineptitude in the new realities of hard power...The best piece of super power military fiction since Tom Clancy&#39;s The Hunt for Red October. Enjoy this riot of a book. And be very afraid - it really could happen like this. -- Robert Fox * Evening Standard *</p><h2>Women and Gender in Early Modern Europe (New Approaches to European History, Series Number 41)</h2><p>This fourth edition of Merry E.

Powerful and artful, and ten years in the writing, it is a masterwork from Jamie O&#x2019;Neill.<br> <br>Jim Mack is a na�ve young scholar and the son of a foolish, aspiring shopkeeper. Doyler Doyle is the rough-diamond son&#x2014;revolutionary and blasphemous&#x2014;of Mr. Mack&#x2019;s old army pal. Out at the Forty Foot, that great jut of rock where gentlemen bathe in the nude, the two boys make a pact: Doyler will teach Jim to swim, and in a year, on Easter of 1916, they will swim to the distant beacon of Muglins Rock and claim that island for themselves. All the while Mr. Mack, who has grand plans for a corner shop empire, remains unaware of the depth of the boys&#x2019; burgeoning friendship and of the changing landscape of a nation.</p><p>You may have read the hype. Irishman Jamie O'Neill was working as a London hospital porter when his 10-year labor of love, the 200,000-word manuscript of <i>At Swim, Two Boys</i>, written on a laptop during quiet patches at work, was suddenly snapped up for a hefty six-figure advance. For once, the book fully deserves the hype.<p> In the spring of 1915, Jim Mack and "the Doyler," two Dublin boys, make a pact to swim to an island in Dublin Bay the following Easter. By the time they do, Dublin has been consumed by the Easter Uprising, and the boys' friendship has blossomed into love--a love that will in time be overtaken by tragedy. O'Neill's prose, playing merrily with vocabulary, syntax, and idiom, has unsurprisingly drawn comparisons to James Joyce and Samuel Beckett, but in his creation of comic characters (such as Jim's pathetic but irrepressible father) and in the sheer scale of his work, Charles Dickens springs to mind first. But Dickens never wrote a love story between young men as achingly beautiful as this. </p><p> In the character of Anthony MacMurrough, who is haunted by voices as he pursues his illegal and dangerous desire for Dublin boys, O'Neill has created a complex and fascinating center to his novel, rescuing the love story from mawkishness, and allowing a serious meditation on history, politics, and desire. For as Ireland seeks its own future free of British government, so Jim, Doyle, and MacMurrough look back to Sparta to find a way to live. As Dr Scrotes, one of MacMurrough's voices, commands: </p><blockquote>Help these boys build a nation of their own. Ransack the histories for clues to their past. Plunder the literature for words they can speak.</blockquote> In this massive, enthralling, and brilliant debut, Jamie O'Neill has indeed done just that: provided a nation for what Walt Whitman calls, in O'Neill's epigraph, "the love of comrades." <i>--Alan Stewart, Amazon.co.uk</i>Raised in County Dublin, <b>Jamie O'Neill</b> is the author of <i>Kilbrack</i> and <i>At Swim, Two Boys,</i> which won the Ferro-Grumley Award for Fiction and the Lambda Literary Award in Gay Men's Fiction.

Whether allowing spiritually formative reading to enhance a literature course, employing table fellowship and shared meals to reinforce concepts in a pre-nursing nutrition course, or using Christian hermeneutical practices to interpret data in an economics course, these teacher-authors envision ways of teaching and learning that are rooted in the rich tradition of Christian practices, as together they reconceive classrooms and laboratories as vital arenas for faith and spiritual growth.</p><p>David I.

She was about to turn ninety and I hadn't seen her for nearly a decade. My brother, Dima, and I were her only family; her lone daughter, our mother, had died years earlier. Baba Seva lived alone now in her old Moscow apartment. When I called to tell her I was coming, she sounded very happy to hear it, and also a little confused.<br><br> My parents and my brother and I left the Soviet Union in 1981. I was six and Dima was sixteen, and that made all the difference. I became an American, whereas Dima remained essentially Russian. As soon as the Soviet Union collapsed, he returned to Moscow to make his fortune. Since then he had made and lost several fortunes; where things stood now I wasn't sure. But one day he Gchatted me to ask if I could come to Moscow and stay with Baba Seva while he went to London for an unspecified period of time.<br><br> "Why do you need to go to London?"<br><br> "I'll explain when I see you."<br><br> "You want me to drop everything and travel halfway across the world and you can't even tell me why?"<br><br> There was something petulant that came out of me when dealing with my older brother. I hated it, and couldn't help myself.<br><br> Dima said, "If you don't want to come, say so. But I'm not discussing this on Gchat."<br><br> "You know," I said, "there's a way to take it off the record. No one will be able to see it."<br><br> "Don't be an idiot."<br><br> He meant to say that he was involved with some very serious people, who would not so easily be deterred from reading his Gchats. Maybe that was true, maybe it wasn't. With Dima the line between those concepts was always shifting.<br><br> As for me, I wasn't really an idiot. But neither was I not an idiot. I had spent four long years of college and then eight much longer years of grad school studying Russian literature and history, drinking beer, and winning the Grad Student Cup hockey tournament (five times!); then I had gone out onto the job market for three straight years, with zero results. By the time Dima wrote me I had exhausted all the available post-graduate fellowships and had signed up to teach online sections in the university's new PMOOC initiative, short for "paid massive online open course," although the "paid" part mostly referred to the students, who really did need to pay, and less to the instructors, who were paid very little. It was definitely not enough to continue living, even very frugally, in New York. In short, on the question of whether I was an idiot, there was evidence on both sides. <br><br> Dima writing me when he did was, on the one hand, providential. On the other hand, Dima had a way of getting people involved in undertakings that were not in their best interests. He had once convinced his now former best friend Tom to move to Moscow to open a bakery. Unfortunately, Tom opened his bakery too close to another bakery, and was lucky to leave Moscow with just a dislocated shoulder. Anyway, I proceeded cautiously. I said, "Can I stay at your place?" Back in 1999, after the Russian economic collapse, Dima bought the apartment directly across the landing from my grandmother's, so helping her out from there would be easy.<br><br> "I'm subletting it," said Dima. "But you can stay in our bedroom in grandma's place. It's pretty clean."<br><br> "I'm thirty-three years old," I said, meaning too old to live with my grandmother.<br><br> "You want to rent your own place, be my guest. But it'll have to be pretty close to Grandma's."<br><br> Our grandmother lived in the center of Moscow. The rents there were almost as high as Manhattan's. On my PMOOC salary I would be able to rent approximately an armchair.<br><br> "Can I use your car?"<br><br> "I sold it."<br><br> "Dude. How long are you leaving for?"<br><br> "I don't know," said Dima. "And I already left."<br><br> "Oh," I said. He was already in London. He must have left in a hurry.<br><br> But I in turn was desperate to leave New York. The last of my old classmates from the Slavic department had recently left for a new job, in California, and my girlfriend of six months, Sarah, had recently dumped me at a Starbucks. "I just don't see where this is going," she had said, meaning I suppose our relationship, but suggesting in fact my entire life. And she was right: even the thing that I had once most enjoyed doing-reading and writing about and teaching Russian literature and history-was no longer any fun. I was heading into a future of halfheartedly grading the half-written papers of half-interested students, with no end in sight.<br><br> Whereas Moscow was a special place for me. It was the city where my parents had grown up, where they had met; it was the city where I was born. It was a big, ugly, dangerous city, but also the cradle of Russian civilization. Even when Peter the Great abandoned it for St. Petersburg in 1713, even when Napoleon sacked it in 1812, Moscow remained, as Alexander Herzen put it, the capital of the Russian people. "They recognized their ties of blood to Moscow by the pain they felt at losing it." Yes. And I hadn't been there in years. Over the course of a few grad-school summers I'd grown tired of its poverty and hopelessness. The aggressive drunks on the subway; the thugs in tracksuits and leather jackets walking around eyeing everyone; the guy eating from the dumpster next to my grandmother's place every night during the summer I spent there in 2000, periodically yelling "Fuckers! Bloodsuckers!" then going back to eating. I hadn't been back since.<br><br> Still, I kept my hands off the keyboard. I needed some kind of concession from Dima, if only for my pride.<br><br> I said, "Is there someplace for me to play hockey?" As my academic career had declined, my hockey playing had ramped up. Even during the summer, I was on the ice three days a week.<br><br> "Are you kidding?" said Dima. "Moscow is a hockey mecca. They're building new rinks all the time. I'll get you into a game as soon as you get here."<br><br> I took that in.<br><br> "Oh, and the wireless signal from my place reaches across the landing," Dima said. "Free wi-fi."<br><br> "OK!" I wrote.<br><br> "OK?"<br><br> "Yeah," I said. "Why not."<br><br> A few days later I went to the Russian consulate on the Upper East Side, stood in line for an hour with my application, and got a one-year visa. Then I wrapped things up in New York: I sublet my room to a rock drummer from Minnesota, returned my books to the library, and fetched my hockey stuff from a locker at the rink. It was all a big hassle, and not cheap, but I spent the whole time imagining the different life I would soon be living and the different person I'd become. I pictured myself carrying groceries for my grandmother; taking her on excursions around the city, including to the movies (she'd always loved the movies); walking with her arm in arm around the old neighborhood and listening to her tales of life under socialism. There was so much about her life that I didn't know, about which I'd never asked. I had been incurious and oblivious; I had believed more in books than I had in people. I pictured myself protesting the Putin regime in the morning, playing hockey in the afternoon, and keeping my grandmother company in the evening. Perhaps there was even some way I might use my grandmother's life as the basis for a journal article. I pictured myself sitting monastically in my room and with my grandmother's stories in hand adding a whole new dimension to my work. Maybe I could put her testimony in italics and intersperse it throughout my article, like in In Our Time.<br><br> On my last night in town my roommates threw me a small party. "To Moscow," they said, raising their cans of beer.<br><br> "To Moscow!" I repeated.<br><br> "And don't get killed," one of them added.<br><br> "I won't get killed," I promised. I was excited. And drunk. It occurred to me that there was a certain glamor that might attend spending time in an increasingly violent and dictatorial Russia-at that very moment bombing the small country of Georgia into submission. At three in the morning I sent a text message to Sarah. "I'm leaving tomorrow," it said, as if I were heading for a very dangerous place. Sarah did not respond. Three hours later I woke up, still drunk, threw the last of my stuff into my huge red suitcase, grabbed my hockey stick, and headed for JFK. I got on my flight and promptly fell asleep.<br><br> Next thing I knew I was standing in the passport control line in the grim basement of Sheremetevo-2 International Airport. It never seemed to change. As long as I'd been flying in here, they made you come down to this basement and wait in line before you got your bags. It was like a purgatory from which you suspected you might be entering someplace other than heaven.<br><br> But the Russians looked different than I remembered them. They were well dressed, with good haircuts, and talking on sleek new cell phones. Even the guards in their light-blue short-sleeve uniforms looked cheerful. Though the line was long, several stood off together to the side, laughing. Oil was selling at $114 a barrel, and their army had just won a short little war with Georgia-is that what they were laughing about?<br><br> Modernization theory said the following: Wealth and technology are more powerful than culture. Give people nice cars, color televisions, and the ability to travel to Europe, and they'll stop being so aggressive. No two countries with McDonald's franchises will ever go to war with each other. People with cell phones are nicer than people without cell phones.<br><br> I wasn't so sure. The Georgians had McDonald's, and the Russians bombed them anyway. As I neared the passport booth, a tall, bespectacled, nicely dressed European, Dutch or German, asked in English if he could cut the line: he had to catch a connecting flight. I nodded yes-we'd have to wait for our luggage anyway-but the man behind me, about the same height as the Dutch guy but much sturdier, in a boxy but not to my eyes inexpensive suit, piped up in Russian-accented English.<br><br> "Go back to end of line."<br><br> "I'm about to miss my flight," said the Dutchman.<br><br> "Go back to end of line."<br><br> I said to him in Russian, "What's the difference?"<br><br> "There's a big difference," he answered.<br><br> "Please?" the Dutchman asked again, in English.<br><br> "I said go back. Now." The Russian turned slightly so that he was square with the Dutchman. The latter man kicked his bag in frustration. Then he picked it up and walked to the back of the line.<br><br> "He made the correct decision," said the Russian guy to me, in Russian, indicating that as a man of principle he was ready to pummel the Dutch guy for cutting the line.<br><br> I didn't answer. A few minutes later, I approached the passport control booth. The young, blond, unsmiling border guard took my battered blue American passport-the passport of a person who lived in a country where you didn't have to carry your passport everywhere you went, where in fact you might not even know where your passport was for months and years at a time-with mild disgust. If he had a passport like mine he'd take better care of it. He checked my name against the terrorist database and buzzed me through the gate to the other side.<br><br> [AU/ED: with an American passport, would Andrei be on the same passport line as Russians? In many airports they separate them, yes?]<br><br> I was in Russia again.<br><br> My grandmother Seva lived in the very center of the city, in an apartment she�d been awarded, in the late 1940s, by Joseph Stalin. My brother, Dima, brought this up sometimes, when he was trying to make a point, and so did my grandmother, when she was in a self-deprecating mood. �My Stalin apartment,� she called it, as if to remind everyone, and herself, of the moral compromise she had made. Still, in general in our family it was understood that if someone was offering you an apartment, and you lived at the time in a drafty room in a communal apartment with your small daughter, your two brothers, and your mom, then you should take the apartment, no matter who it was from. And it�s not like Stalin himself was handing her the keys or asking for anything in return. She was at the time a young professor of history at Moscow State University, and had consulted on a film about Ivan the Great, the fifteenth-century �gatherer of the lands of Rus� and grandfather to Ivan the Terrible, which Stalin so enjoyed that he declared everyone involved should get an apartment. So in addition to �my Stalin apartment,� my grandmother also called it �my Ivan the Great apartment,� and then, if she was speaking honestly, �my Yolka apartment,� after her daughter, my mother, for whom she had been willing to do anything at all.<br><br> To get to this apartment I exchanged some dollars at the booth outside baggage claim-it was about twenty-four rubles per dollar at the time-and took the brand-new express train to Savelovsky Railway Station, passing miles of crumbling Soviet apartment blocks, and the old (also crumbling) turn-of-the-century industrial belt just outside the center. Along the way the massive guy sitting next to me-about my age, in jeans and a short-sleeve button-down-struck up a conversation.<br><br> "What model is that?" he asked, about my phone. I had bought a SIM card at the airport and was now putting it in the phone and seeing if it worked.<br><br> Here we go, I thought. My phone was a regular T-Mobile flip phone.But I figured this was just a prelude to the guy trying to rob me. I grew tense. My hockey stick was in the luggage rack above us, and anyway it would have been hard to swing it at this guy on this train.<br><br> "Just a regular phone," I said. "Samsung." I grew up speaking Russian and still speak it with my father and my brother but I have a slight, difficult-to-place accent. I occasionally make small grammatical mistakes or put the stress on the wrong syllable. And I was rusty.<br><br> The guy picked up on this, as well as the fact that my olive skin set me apart from most of the Slavs on this fancy train. "Where you from?" he said. He used the familiar ty rather than vy-which could mean he was being friendly, because we were the same age and on the same train, or it could mean he was asserting his right to call me anything he wanted. I couldn't tell. He began to guess where I might be from. "Spain?" he said. "Or Turkey?"</p><h2>Rail-Trails Iowa &amp; Missouri: The definitive guide to the state's top multiuse trails</h2><p><b>Explore 44 of the best rail-trails and multiuse pathways across two states.</b> <br><br>All around the country, unused railroad corridors have been converted to public multiuse trails.

What comes as a surprise to many of us is this: forgiving yourself can be much harder still. When you are the wrongdoer who needs to be forgiven&#x2014;and you are the one who needs to forgive&#x2014;a struggle results that has few equals.<br><br>In <i>Moving Forward</i> you will learn research-proven steps to forgiving others and yourself. The steps also have been tear-tested in the difficulties and darkness of real life and worked through in the counseling room. As we work through the six steps in the chapters that follow, you will gain life-changing insight into your nature as a person. And you will discover a number of truths about yourself&#x2014;things you might already have suspected but weren&#x2019;t yet prepared to take a close look at.<br><br>The truth about you (and all of us) is hard to accept, but it&#x2019;s powerful and life changing when you do face it and engage with it. The truth is this: you are more flawed than you can imagine. But, miraculously, you also are far more valuable and more cherished than you can imagine.<br><br>You&#x2014;and everyone else&#x2014;are a contrast of flaws and unspeakable value that is difficult to fathom. But when you do get it, and I finally &#x201c;got it&#x201d; as I moved through my own struggles, the breakthrough is a glorious shift in the way you live. So join with me to work through a process that will be much harder than you expect but will end with the freedom you have been seeking. You can live without self-blame and condemnation, without the familiar burden of guilt, and in a place where you can embrace the precious value of being a flawed person who is deeply loved by God. The work that is required to reach self-forgiveness will seem daunting. And with good reason. It is more demanding than most of the challenges you will take on in life. But the difficult work eventually achieves a goal that few people reach. Self-forgiveness releases you from shame and self-condemnation and leads to freedom and long-lasting internal peace.<br><br>All of this begins with God&#x2019;s recipe for self-acceptance, which is summed up as &#x201c;you are flawed, but precious.&#x201d; The real struggle in gaining meaningful victory over self-blame is not simply saying you are forgiving yourself. You can forgive yourself with full understanding and yet still feel just as guilty and ashamed of your misdeeds. The hardest struggle&#x2014;<br>beyond self-forgiveness&#x2014;is accepting yourself as a flawed individual (we all are), and yet being convinced that you are precious to the Lord. You are valued more highly than you can imagine.<br><br>After you work through the steps to self-forgiveness, you will experience something that Paul came to realize in his life. Paul couldn&#x2019;t change his past persecution of Christians, but he knew he was living a new life. Likewise, you can admit to your past failures and the things you regret yet strain forward to the future (see Philippians 3:13).<br><br>I hope your sense of hope will be renewed as we embark on a journey that will involve a lot of work but will lead to the destination we all long for. So are you ready to work through the six steps to forgiving yourself?<br><br>Here is the sneak-peek outline.<br>Step 1: Receive God&#x2019;s Forgiveness<br>Step 2: Repair Relationships<br>Step 3: Rethink Ruminations<br>Step 4: REACH Emotional Self-Forgiveness<br>Step 5: Rebuild Self-Acceptance<br>Step 6: Resolve to Live Virtuously<br><br>Now let&#x2019;s get started.</p><h2>Sweet Temptation</h2><p><b>FROM <i>NEW YORK TIMES</i> BESTSELLING AUTHOR OF THE BREATHLESS TRILOGY MAYA BANKS</b><br><br><b>He was a by-the-book cop who broke the rules in the bedroom... </b><br><br>Micah Hudson has painful secrets he's run hard from.

Even today his radical critique of Western missionary methods is cutting edge, though the biblical principles he advocates are now being embraced more and more by some ministries that are not tradition-bound. While this book and its sequel (Spontaneous Expansion) address mission work specifically, the principles described do not apply only to how the people of one country do missionary work in another. These books really are about what the Bible has to show us about how to carry out the mission of the church, whether in our own culture, in ministering cross-culturally in our own back yard, or planting churches across an ocean. If Allen is right in the conclusions he draws about finance, many church planting efforts may be operating by financial principles that do more to hinder rather than help establish a healthy, self-supporting church. Allen&#x2019;s observations on the biblical pattern for selecting and equipping elders for local church leadership challenged not only the status quo of the Anglican church of his day, but continue to challenge the practices of most churches today. The fact &#x201c;Missionary Methods&#x201d; was written a century ago but still applies to our times is evidence of the Truth it holds. Not an easy read, Allen&#x2019;s book nonetheless provokes much thought and reflection. Also an excellent commentary on Paul&#x2019;s letters, Allen&#x2019;s book is a must read for everyone that is even contemplating a career overseas&#x2014;and even more so if that career involves missionary work.</p><p>The passion of his writing and the fundamental concerns which he addresses mean there is wealth of relevant and thought-provoking analysis in these highly commendable books. --Mission Catalyst, magazine of the BMS World MissionRoland Allen (1868&#x2013;1947) was an English missionary. He was born in Bristol, England, the son of an Anglican priest; but was orphaned early in life. He trained for ministry at Oxford and became a priest in 1893. Allen spent two periods in Northern China working for the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel. The first from 1895 to 1900 ended due to the Boxer Rebellion, during which Allen was forced to flee to the British Legation in Beijing. He was chaplain to community throughout much of the siege. After a period back in England, he returned to North China in 1902, but was forced home due to illness. These early experiences led him to a radical reassessment of his own vocation and the theology and missionary methods of the Western churches. Allen became an early advocate of establishing churches which from the beginning would be self-supporting, self-propagating, and self-governing, adapted to local conditions and not merely imitations of Western Christianity. These views were confirmed by a trip to India in 1910 and by later research in Canada and East Africa. It is with this background that Allen wrote his book Missionary Methods which was first published in 1912. Allen&#x2019;s approach to Mission strategy for indigenous churches is based on the study of Saint Paul&#x2019;s missionary methods as he is convinced that in them can be found the solution to most of the difficulties of the day. He believed it was the recognition of the church as a local entity and trust in the Holy Spirit&#x2019;s indwelling within the converts and churches which was the mark of Paul&#x2019;s success. In contrast was Allen&#x2019;s belief that the people of his day were unable to entrust their converts to the Holy Spirit and instead relied in His work through them. His views became increasingly influential, though Allen himself became disillusioned with the established churches. He spent the last years of his life in Kenya, establishing a reclusive church of his own devising, centered on an idiosyncratic family rite. Allen died in Nairobi. His funeral was conducted by the Bishop of Mombasa and his gravestone can be found in Nairobi's City Park. A simple stone cross with the inscription on the pedestal reads: "ROLAND ALLEN, CLERK IN HOLY ORDERS, 1868-1947, I AM THE RESURRECTION AND THE LIFE SAITH THE LORD"</p><h2>The South Pole: Complete and Unabridged with Illustrations, Charts, Maps and Appendices</h2><p><b>This superb edition of <i>The South Pole</i> contains all of the original and essential photographs, charts, maps and appendices from the Amundsen expedition.</b> <br><br> This book chronicles the epic journey of Roald Amundsen and his team of hand-picked sailors, from the moment the journey was conceived to the triumphant conclusion and acclaim. The South Pole remains a classic chronicle of exploration and adventure for its detail, descriptions and thoroughness. Amundsen successfully captures both the moments of excitement and action, the day-to-day struggles, and the routines undertaken by the men who undertook the dangerous journey. <br><br> In the detailed chapters, we hear of the difficulties the men encountered during their crossing of the icy wastes of the Antarctic. Amundsen's first expedition - which almost ended in fatal disaster - is much detailed, as are the valuable lessons the team picked up in this perilous brush with death. The painstaking preparations and establishment of the base camp is noted, while Amundsen's use of sled dogs and skis are demonstrated as vital for the group's eventual success. <br><br> The expedition was imperiled by the limits of their technology; including clothes comprised of animal furs; their ship - the Fram - whose ice-breaking capacities were far inferior to those of the modern day; and the lack of sophisticated navigation tools. Furthermore the route which Amundsen took was across the previously uncharted Axel Heiberg Glacier; fortuitously, the flatter terrain offered a straightforward means of passage. <br><br> The moment of triumph as the group finally reached the South Pole of the Earth is tempered by the reminder that they must traverse the glacier again on the return trip. Several of the sled dogs were killed for their meat during the trek home. Remarkably there were no human fatalities, a fact which only increased the admiration and laudatory sentiments from the leaders of the time. <br><br> The Amundsen expedition was one of the most famous of its era, being as it marked the first time a human had ever reached the South Pole. Tragically the rival Scott expedition - which ran concurrently with Amundsen's - resulted in the death of most of the expedition members, including Scott himself.</p><p></p><h2>A Master Class in Gremlin-Taming(R): The Absolutely Indispensable Next Step for Freeing Yourself from the Monster of the Mind</h2><p><p>Rick Carson's <em>Taming Your Gremlin</em>� has helped hundreds of thousands of people combat the inner saboteur lurking in the recesses of every human mind.

Although little is known about Patanjali (most scholars estimate that he lived in India circa 200&#x2013;300 B.C.), his writings have long been recognized as a vital contribution to the philosophy and practice of yoga. This new, expert translation of the original Sanskrit text of Patanjali&#x2019;s best-known work presents his seminal ideas and methods in accessible, plain-language English. <br><br>Patanjali organized the sutra into four parts: Samadhi (absorption), Sadhana (practice), Vibhuti (supernatural powers), and Kaivalya (liberation). Each represents a step in breaking free of our limited definition of consciousness and training the mind to achieve oneness with the universe. Geshe Michael Roach, one of the most respected teachers of Tibetan Buddhism in America and a renowned scholar of Sanskrit, provides authoritative commentary on each of the sutras. His notes and clarification are straightforward and highly readable, untainted by obscure, academic terminology or New Age jargon. The first edition of the Yoga Sutra to present a Buddhist perspective, this paperback original will be welcomed by students and spiritual seekers alike.</p><p><b>GESHE MICHAEL ROACH</b> is a fully ordained Buddhist monk and has been a teacher of Buddhism since 1981. He is also a scholar of Sanskrit, Tibetan, and Russian, and has translated many works in these languages into English. He founded the Asian Classics Institute and the Asian Classics Input Project and has been active in the restoration of the Sera Mey Tibetan Monastery, where he received his training. He lives in New York and Arizona.<p>1<br><br>Yogi, Dancer,</p><p>Thinker, Doctor<br><br>A Short Book about Yoga:</p><p>The Yoga Sutra of Master Patanjali</p><p>Patanjala Yoga Sutram<br><br></p><p>A sutra is a short book that tells us the very crux of something--ideas tied tight together, with a stitch of thread. The Yoga Sutra is the mother book of all yoga. It was written about two thousand years ago by Master Patanjali.</p><p>Master Patanjali was a great yogi; he knew the physical poses of yoga and the art of breathing: yoga of the body. He was also a great thinker and meditator--a master of the yoga of the mind. He wrote as well famous books on medicine and on Sanskrit, the ancient tongue from which almost all our languages come. He is recognized too as the father of the classical dance of India.</p><p>Dancer, doctor, yogi, thinker, master of ancient words. What do they all have in common?</p><p>Yoga, as we shall see, has many meanings. One is the union of the winds within our inner body. We unite these winds with our yoga, when we think and understand. The winds will sing within us, the very first words of all. They will flow free, and force us to dance, and to run to heal others.<br><br>First Cornerstone</p><p>The Chapter on Meditation<br><br>2</p><p>It Begins with Meditation</p><p>Prathamah Samadhi Padah<br><br>The Yoga Sutra has four chapters: four cornerstones upon which it stands, like a table on four legs.</p><p>The first chapter describes five crucial steps that we all pass through during our spiritual journey. This journey always begins from pain: we see death, we see people suffer, we dream of saving them. And the journey ends when we change, finally, into a sacred being who actually has the power to save them.</p><p>In between its beginning and its end, the road we travel has five parts: five paths, each one leading into the next, each one marked by its own special milestones. Stepping up to each new path from the one before it can only be done in one way. We must be in deep meditation; we must learn to meditate.</p><p>Thus it is that the first chapter, the chapter on the five paths, is called the Chapter on Meditation.<br><br>3</p><p>The Power of Humility</p><p>I.1&nbsp; I will now review for you</p><p>how we become whole.</p><p>Atha yoga-anushashanam.<br><br>Another meaning of yoga is to become whole. Ultimately we only become whole when we are truly capable of helping others with the things that really matter: when we can help them understand how they came into this world, and what life is for, and whether it has to end with losing everything.</p><p>This then, says Master Patanjali, is why I write my short book. He wants us to know, from the very beginning, that his book contains something of ultimate importance, something worth the precious hours of our life.</p><p>And I will only review, says the Master, what I have heard from my holy teachers. He attacks his own pride: I have nothing new to tell you, and there is nothing here that I have made up myself. I am only a vessel for the wisdom of the ages, and I pass it on to you--tried, tested, and unadulterated.</p><p>And he says "I will" write this book, for once a Master promises to do something, he does it--or dies trying.</p><p>All the great books of India begin with these three noble themes. Their power, their karma, stops all obstacles to the work we now begin.<br><br>4</p><p>To Become Whole</p><p>I.2&nbsp; We become whole by stopping</p><p>how the mind turns.</p><p>Yogash chitta virtti nirodhah.<br><br>These are perhaps the most important words of the entire Yoga Sutra. Here the Master tells us another meaning of yoga, which is learning to stop the Great Mistake.</p><p>And what is the Great Mistake? Our mind turns; meaning it turns things around the wrong way. A mother takes her small child to a movie. On the screen, a man is hurting a puppy.</p><p>The child cries out, and reaches to stop the man. Perhaps the child can even get up to the screen, and try to hit the man.</p><p>But this doesn't stop the man; it has nothing to do with the man. And the child hurts her own hand in the process.</p><p>Our mind makes this same kind of mistake, every day, every moment of every day. We need to stop the mistake, and that is yoga. Pain is real--yes--and it really hurts people. But we can only stop it if we can stop misunderstanding where it comes from. And this is what the Yoga Sutra teaches us to do.<br><br>5</p><p>The Seer</p><p>I.3-4&nbsp; On that day</p><p>the seer comes to dwell</p><p>within his own real nature.</p><p>Otherwise it follows</p><p>the form of the turning.</p><p>Tada drashtuh svarupevasthanam.</p><p>Virtti sarupyam itaratra.<br><br>The most important day in our spiritual journey is the day that we first stop the Great Mistake. We stop seeing things the wrong way. The child realizes that the bad man is not really on the movie screen.</p><p>It only lasts for a brief time, the first time. And then, despite ourselves, we go back to making the same old mental mistake. But for a few minutes, we see the way we really are: we see that we are not at all the way we always thought we were.</p><p>These precious minutes, our first contact with the ultimate reality, are thus called the Path of Seeing. Not because we see these things with our eyes, but because we see them in very deep meditation, with our mind.</p><p>Until the day we see, our life continues to follow after the tragic mistake our mind is making, turning things around the wrong way. Until the child sees how things really are, she strikes out at the bad man on the screen, hurting herself and her mother too.<br><br>6</p><p>A Day in the Mind</p><p>I.5-6&nbsp; The mind turns</p><p>in five different ways.</p><p>They can be involved with afflictions</p><p>or free of them.</p><p>The five are correct perceptions,</p><p>mistaken perceptions, imagination, sleep, and memories.</p><p>Virttayah panchatayyah klishta-aklishtah.</p><p>Pramana viparyaya vikalpa nidra smirtayah.<br><br>In a general sense, the mind turns or operates in many different ways: the ancient books of India list hundreds of different mental functions. Here though the Master chooses to deal with only five states of mind because, in a typical twenty-four-hour day, our mind will always be in one of these five states.</p><p>That is, we are usually seeing most things correctly, throughout the day. (It's true that I may misunderstand how I am, but not that I am.) Occasionally though we do make mistakes about what we see, and we bang the car.</p><p>We use our imagination to plan or to daydream, and we spend a good part of each day in sleep. We constantly call on our memories.</p><p>Our states of mind are sometimes stained by negative thoughts, thoughts that afflict us and make us unhappy. The ultimate negative thought is that same Great Mistake.</p><p>The goal of our yoga is not to stop all thoughts--that would be like throwing the baby out with the bathwater. We simply want to stop the mistake, and all the unhappiness it causes. We want to make our minds ultimately clear, and happy, and loving.<br><br>7</p><p>Right Seeing</p><p>I.7&nbsp; The different types of correct perception</p><p>are those that are direct,</p><p>deductive, or based on authority.</p><p>Pratyaksha-anumana-agamah pramanani.<br><br>The vast majority of all that we see we see correctly. Even in the first few minutes out of bed in the morning, we have already had hundreds of correct perceptions: the sun is shining, these are my socks, breakfast smells good.</p><p>Correct perceptions are strong. Once we see something with a correct perception, we can truly say that thing exists.</p><p>These correct perceptions come in three types. Most of them are the direct type. I see a color, I hear a sound, I smell or taste or touch something. Hearing our thoughts in our own minds is also a direct type of correct perception.</p><p>Deduction is another kind of correct perception: I may not be able to see my socks on the floor in the morning, if they're covered by my pants. But if I dropped them there last night and I've had no visitors in the meantime, I know the socks are there, as surely as if I see them.</p><p>The last kind of correct perception is based on authority: I'm in my bedroom and can't see the kitchen, but Mother tells me there's still some breakfast left. And I know it's there, because she's a truthful person.<br><br>8</p><p>A Leaf in the Road</p><p>I.8&nbsp; Mistaken perceptions</p><p>are wrong impressions that are mired</p><p>in false appearances.</p><p>Viparyayo mithya jnyanam atadrupa prathistham.<br><br>In between hundreds or thousands of correct perceptions, we might miss-see something completely. I'm driving down the road at dusk on a windy autumn day, and a small mouse scurries across the road under my tires. I slam on the brakes with a screech.</p><p>Then I realize that the "mouse" was only the false appearance of a mouse: it was really only a dry leaf blown across the road. And then there's this momentary sense of emptiness--the mouse is gone, it was never there--followed by a slightly foolish feeling as I continue down the road.</p><p>Now it's absolutely essential to realize that, on one level, even our correct perceptions are all incorrect. That is, the socks in my hand are socks--that's correct. But deep in my heart is this belief that they are socks that are in my hand because I own them, because I found them at the store, and because I bought them.</p><p>All of these ideas about my socks are completely incorrect. There are no socks like that--no more than the man in the movie. It's all the Great Mistake, a mistaken perception that causes all the pain in the world.<br><br>9</p><p>Pictures in the Mind</p><p>I.9-11&nbsp; Imagination is a mental impression</p><p>that follows a word,</p><p>and is devoid of any concrete basis.</p><p>Sleep is a case where the mind turns</p><p>without any object at all</p><p>to help it grow.</p><p>Memory is the ability not to forget</p><p>an object that you have experienced.</p><p>Shabda jnyaya-anupati vastu shunyo vikalpah.</p><p>Abhava pratyaya vishaya-asampramoshah smirtih.<br><br>When we plan a dinner, we see in our minds the finished meal, although that meal doesn't yet correspond to any concrete thing. The words "What's for dinner?" inspire this picture in our imagination.</p><p>Most of our perceptions during the day are triggered by some outside object: seeing an apple is set off by the apple--in a sense the seeing depends, or hinges upon, the apple. When we sleep or dream there may not be any such outer object, but still the mind is turning, or operating, at a low level.</p><p>When we have a memory of something, again there is no outer object: just an approximate picture in the mind, sort of a shorthand note to remind us of something.</p><p>And so in the course of an entire day, our mind wends its way through different outside objects and inside images or thoughts. But unless we truly understand things--unless we understand what yoga really means--then every single perception and imagination we ever have is infected by the Great Mistake. Feelings, strong feelings, come up about the things we think we see--and the child beats her fist against the bad man on the screen.<br><br>10</p><p>Approaching the Door</p><p>I.12-13&nbsp; Stopping it requires constant practice,</p><p>and giving up your attachments.</p><p>Constant practice means</p><p>striving to be there.</p><p>Abhyasa vairagyabhyam tan nirodhah.</p><p>Tatra sthitau yatnobhyasah.<br><br>The way to stop the Great Mistake is to work our way through all five of the paths. We reach the first path by giving up our attachments, and this requires developing the habit of constant practice.</p><p>In a general sense, "constant practice" here means the willingness to work very hard to reach our perfect destiny, far beyond the mistakes our mind now makes. Quite simply, we will never be able to complete all the hard work needed to reach our destiny if we don't have a very strong motivation for doing so.</p><p>This motivation comes to all of us at some point in our lives. Most often it is some kind of personal disaster or tragedy: the person we most love dies or leaves us, we find out we have cancer--anything that wakes us up to what really matters. People are in pain, and it's up to us to help them. It is our destiny to be the one who helps them.</p><p>We begin with a daily inner practice. It will always include three essential elements: being careful never to hurt others; learning to pray or meditate; and relentlessly exploring the question of where things really came from.</p></p><h2>DK Eyewitness Family Guide New York City (Travel Guide)</h2><p><b>Discover how the whole family can enjoy a visit to the Big Apple, from the top of the Empire State Building to a hot dog cart in Central Park, from exciting museums and shops to any number of historic carousels.</b><br><br>The best things to do in New York City are all approached from a family-friendly angle.

Your regimen is effective because I continually receive statements like: 'You look fantastic! What do you do to keep looking so young?' I know for a fact that people think I am considerably younger than my chronological age." SANDY (55), NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE<br><br>Part I of this book describes the Problem--the fact that we are genetically programmed to age, to enjoy optimal health for a relatively short period of time, and then are forced to spend much of the rest of our lives dealing with the effects of aging, a process that has as its sole purpose the destruction of our health and our ultimate demise. Before we begin our discussion of the various processes associated with aging, it is important to realize that growing older (and wiser!) is not the same thing as aging. Everyone grows older all the time, but we aren't necessarily aging as we do so since, by definition, the aging process is one of deterioration.<br><br>You grew older today, but did you age as well? If you drank a few cups of green tea, had five servings of fruits and vegetables, exercised for at least 30 minutes at your target heart rate, took nutritional supplements optimized for your age and health situation, spent quality time with close friends and loved ones, consumed a glass of red wine, had a romantic (and sensual!) time with your spouse or significant other, and got 8 hours of quality sleep, then you probably aged very little if at all. If you were a coach potato, ate doughnuts for breakfast, skipped lunch, consumed an excessive amount of coffee, smoked cigarettes, and got into stressful arguments with friends, co-workers, and loved ones, then you probably aged a lot. People can look old in their thirties or young in their sixties, and the lifestyle choices you make every hour make all the difference.<br><br>Multiple processes cause us to age. Some are simple, such as the depletion of a vital substance called phosphatidylcholine in our cell membranes (which you can reverse by supplementing with that substance as we discuss below). Some are complex, such as keeping your most important organ--your brain--healthy. In this chapter, we'll discuss optimal brain health along with sleep since sleep is so vital to brain function. Then we'll move down to the heart, the digestive tract, and the sexual organs and hormones. We'll complete our overview of how the body works with a discussion of various metabolic processes, including inflammation, methylation, and glycation, and finally look at genomics, the new field that is unlocking the secrets of our genes, which control and regulate all bodily functions.<br><br>WE THINK, THEREFORE WE ARE<br><br>Your brain makes up only 2 percent of your weight yet receives 20 percent of the blood coming from the heart and uses 20 percent of your body's oxygen and glucose. It also represents 50 percent of your genetic complexity. In other words, half of your genes describe the design of your brain, with the other half describing the organization of the other 98 percent of your body. Moreover, your brain is the master puppeteer: It controls every beat of your heart, every blink of your eyes, the release of your hormones, not to mention all of your willful activities. It has long been regarded as the seat of consciousness, the true you. So it makes sense to consider what you can do to keep it healthy--and happy, too! As it turns out, there is a lot you can do. The ideas in this chapter can dramatically slow down brain aging and help you avoid the often catastrophic downsides of brain dysfunction.<br><br>Intelligence is arguably the most important phenomenon in the world because intelligence allows us to understand and shape our environments. The best example we have of an intelligent entity is the human brain itself. And the secret of its design is not hidden from us. Although there's a skull around it, we can see inside a living brain with increasingly precise scanning technologies. This is a wonderful example of Ray's law of accelerating returns: The spatial resolution of brain scanning is doubling every year, and the amount of data we are gathering on the brain is also doubling every year.<br><br>We now know the human brain is composed of about 100 billion neurons plus a trillion glial support cells. It was originally thought that the glial cells just provided physical support for the neurons, but recent studies have demonstrated that they play a role in influencing the synapses, which are the connections between neurons. We have about 100 trillion such connections, and that is indeed where most of the action takes place. So there is a lot of complexity.<br><br>We are gathering an exponentially expanding mountain of data on the brain, but can we understand it? A controversy going back thousands of years to the days of Plato is whether we are intelligent enough to understand our own intelligence. Computer scientist Douglas Hofstadter wrote that "it could be simply an accident of fate that our brains are too weak to understand themselves." Since Hofstadter wrote that line in 1979, we have shown that this is not the case. As we gather enough data on specific brain regions, we have been able to model these areas in precise, mathematical terms and actually simulate them on computers. For example, computer scientist Lloyd Watts and his colleagues have created a computer simulation of a dozen regions of the auditory cortex, the regions of the brain responsible for processing sound from the ears. Applying sophisticated psychoacoustic tests to Watts's simulation produces results very similar to applying these tests to human auditory perception. At MIT, there is a similar model and simulation of the visual cortex, which processes visual information.<br><br>At the University of Texas, there is a simulation of the cerebellum, an important region that makes up more than half of the brain's neurons and is responsible for skill formation, for example, catching a fly ball. We have always wondered how a 10-year-old accomplishes this feat. All she has to do is solve a dozen simultaneous differential equations in a few seconds, but most 10-year-olds have not yet taken calculus. We now understand how this works. Those equations are indeed solved by her cerebellum using a mathematical technique called basis functions. It takes place, of course, without conscious awareness, and we do have to train the cerebellum to learn specific tasks, which is why practicing a skill is important. Again, a variety of tests on this computer simulation of the cerebellum provides results similar to human skill formation using our biological cerebellum. This illustrates the oft-stated insight that although the brain is capable of some remarkable accomplishments, we perform these feats without much understanding of how our brains actually carry out these missions.<br><br>An ambitious project is underway at IBM to simulate the cerebral cortex, arguably the most important region of the brain and the one responsible for our abstract reasoning. As of the writing of this book, this simulation has successfully undergone its first set of tests.<br><br>As we continue the accelerating progress toward "reverse-engineering," understanding the methods of how the brain works, we'll gain far greater insight into our own human nature, which has been the goal of the arts and science since we first wrote symbols on stone tablets over 5,000 years ago. The results of this grand engineering project, which now includes over 50,000 scientists and engineers, will also provide us with methods for ever more intelligent computer software. But the benefit most relevant to this book is that we will gain far more powerful ways of fixing what goes wrong in our brains.<br><br>And there is a lot that does go wrong. As we pointed out before, evolution focused on our formative years and enough of our early adulthood to allow us to raise our children so that they became self-sufficient. As a result, keeping our brains healthy much past our twenties was not a trait selected by natural selection when our brains evolved. Our brains are subject to either sudden or gradual decline with age, to self-destructive addictive behaviors, to depression and anxiety disorders, and to many other limitations, not to mention potentially catastrophic lapses of judgment.<br><br>YOU CREATE YOUR BRAIN<br><br>Perhaps the most important insight relevant to brain health that has come from recent advances in information technology is the plasticity of the brain. Since the mid-19th century, it was thought that brain regions were hardwired for specific tasks and that neurons could not be replaced. In 1857, French neurosurgeon Paul Broca related specific cognitive deficits to particular regions of the brain affected by injury or surgery. For more than a century, it was believed that unlike other areas of the body that are capable of repairing themselves, the brain could not replace its neurons and connections that had been lost or damaged and that we are continually and irretrievably losing brain matter.<br><br>From recent brain imaging research, we now know the brain possesses plasticity, meaning it is perhaps the most dynamic and self-organizing organ of the body. Although there is some degree of specialization in the skills of different regions of the brain, stroke victims are often able to transfer skills from a damaged region to one that is undamaged. Moreover, we can see in recent brain scans how we actually grow new brain connections and even create new neurons from stem cells as a result of our thoughts.<br><br>In an experiment with monkeys at the University of California, brain scans obtained before and after the animals were trained to perform a specific task involving the nimbleness of one finger showed substantial growth in neural connections associated with controlling that finger. An experiment with humans who were taught how to play the violin showed substantial growth of connections associated with the fingers of the left hand responsible for controlling the notes. A brain scanning experiment at Rutgers and Stanford universities involved training dyslexic (reading- impaired) students how to distinguish between hard-to-resolve consonants such as "p" and "b." After the training, brain scans showed substantial growth and increased activity in the region of the brain responsible for this discrimination. Paula Tallal, one of the scientists who created this dyslexic training system, commented that "you create your brain from the input you get."<br><br>In the latest brain image studies, we can see real-time movies of individual interneuronal connections actually creating new synapses (connection points between neurons), so we can see our brain create our thoughts and in turn see our thoughts create our brain.<br><br>The true meaning of Descartes' famous dictum, "I think therefore I am," has been debated for centuries, but these findings provide a new interpretation: I do indeed create my mind from my own thoughts.<br><br>IN VIVO IMAGES OF NEURAL DENDRITES SHOWING SPINE AND SYNAPSE FORMATION<br><br>The lesson of these new insights is that our brain is entirely like any of our physical muscles: Use it or lose it. We all know what happens to your muscles if you are bedridden from illness or just living the couch potato life. The same thing happens to your brain. By failing to engage it in intellectually challenging activities, your brain will fail to grow new connections, and it will indeed become disorganized and ultimately dysfunctional. The converse is also true for both body and brain. If someone who has not been physically active for a sustained period starts a program of physical therapy and regular exercise, she can regain her muscle mass and tone within a matter of months. The same thing is true of your brain.<br><br>Many studies demonstrate that people who maintain their intellectual activities throughout life remain mentally sharp. A Canadian study called the Victoria Longitudinal Study has shown that older individuals who routinely engage in mentally challenging activities, including everyday activities such as reading, remain mentally alert, as compared with the substantial cognitive decline of those who do not engage in these activities.<br><br>Just as we have more than one muscle to keep fit, we have more than one region of the brain that we need to exercise. To keep the cerebellum--the region of the brain that controls voluntary movement--healthy, you should engage in physical activities, particularly those that involve the development of skills such as sports.<br><br>The concept that certain brain activities occur in the left half of the brain and others on the right is only partially true. A recently discovered type of neuron called the spindle cell crosses from one side of the brain to the other and appears to be heavily involved in higher-level emotions. In recent brain scanning experiments using new types of scanners that can image individual neurons, these cells "light up" (become especially active) when test subjects are shown a picture of a loved one or hear their child crying. The spindle cells are unusual in that they can be very long, spanning the entire length of the brain, and are deeply interconnected with other neurons. One spindle cell will typically have hundreds of thousands of connections to other cells. Unlike the highly organized cells of the cerebral cortex, the brain region responsible for rational thought, the spindle cells display unpredictable and fairly exotic structures and connection patterns.<br><br>They are connected to almost every other region, so they receive input from everything else going on in our brain. From these studies, it is apparent that the spindle cells are not doing rational problem solving, which is why we don't have rational control over our emotional responses.<br><br>Although each spindle cell is very complex, we don't have very many of them. Only about 80,000 of our 10 billion neurons are spindle cells. Only a few animal species have spindle cells at all. Gorillas have about 16,000, bonobos about 2,100, and chimpanzees about 1,800. Recently we have discovered that whales actually have more than humans. Interestingly, newborn humans don't have any spindle cells. They begin to appear at about 4 months and develop through 3 years of age, which exactly mirrors the ability of young children to deal with higher-level emotions and moral issues.<br><br>About 45,000 of the spindle cells are in the right hemisphere, and 35,000 are in the left. This small imbalance appears to account for the notion that the right brain is the emotional brain and the left brain is the more rational brain. Although the right brain does have more spindle cells, both halves of the brain are engaged in logical and emotional activities. Individuals with a rare disorder who use only half of their brain often appear to behave almost normally, engaging in both logical and emotional activities.</p><h2>The Quilt (Alida Series)</h2><p>1944. Wartime. <br><br>A six-year-old boy goes to spend the summer with his grandmother Alida in a small town near the Canadian border. With the men all gone off to fight, the women are left to run the farms. There&#x2019;s plenty for the boy to do&#x2014;trying to help with the chores, getting to know the dog, and the horses, cows, pigs, and chickens. <br><br>But when his cousin Kristina goes into labor, he can&#x2019;t do a thing. Instead, the house fills with women come to help and to wait, and to work on a quilt together. This is no common, everyday quilt, but one that contains all the stories of the boy&#x2019;s family. The quilt tells the truth, past and future: of happiness, courage, and pain; of the greatest joy, and the greatest loss. And as they wait, the women share these memorable stories with the boy.</p><p>A companion to <i>Alida&#x2019; s Song</i> and <i>The Cookcamp</i>, Gary Paulsen's <i>The Quilt</i> spends another summer with "the boy" and his grandmother, Alida. World War II is being fought in Europe, and the boy&#x2019;s mother, working in a munitions factory in Chicago, sends her six-year-old son to stay with his grandmother in Minnesota. When Alida&#x2019;s neighbor Kristina goes into labor, Alida packs up the boy and goes to Kristina&#x2019;s farm to help. Mystified, the boy watches as other women arrive, water is boiled, and a quilt is brought out. Now it&#x2019;s time to listen, as the quilt--through the women--tells its stories about family, love, loss, and strength. <p> As in Paulsen&#x2019;s many other semi-autobiographical stories for young readers (the <i>Brian</i> books, <i>Guts</i>, etc.), the author&#x2019;s voice is never far beneath the surface. His bitterness towards his own mother, for example (as revealed in the foreword), comes across in lines like this: "Soon, though, other people--men--came to visit her and she started to do very grown-up things. He did not fit in, and when life with his mother became too difficult, he went to live with his grandmother." Although this presence may be irritating to some readers, the details of a remembered time on a farm with wonderfully strong women should appeal to all.

Even Butler's LIVES OF THE SAINTS, the 'bible' of this category, lists far more men than women. No book about the saints could ignore such beloved early martyrs as Agnes of Rome and Lucy of Syracuse but this new book will introduce readers to many new women who have been canonized or beatified by Pope John Paul II. Of the more than 377 women mentioned in the book, 159 have been canonized or beatified since 1979. Approximately 100 of them lived in the twentieth century.</p><p>This new book is also unique in that it uses the saint's own words wherever possible, taking advantage of newly discovered archives, memoirs and other primary sources. It will contain resources such as internet shrines and other websites, as well as little&#x2013;known information on the canonization process.</p></p><p><p>Sarah Gallick is the author of seven books and a founding member of Catholic Women at Work.

It&#39;s a question most of us consider only hypothetically-opting instead to &#34;do what we have to do&#34; to earn a living. But in the critically acclaimed bestseller &#34;The Monk and the Riddle&#34;, entrepreneurial sage Randy Komisar asks us to answer it for real. The book&#39;s timeless advice - to make work pay not just in cash, but in experience, satisfaction, and joy - will be embraced by anyone who wants success to come not just from what they do, but from who they are.At once a fictional tale of Komisar&#39;s encounters with a would-be entrepreneur and a personal account of how Komisar found meaning not in work&#39;s rewards but in work itself, the book illustrates what&#39;s wrong with the mainstream thinking that we should sacrifice our lives to make a living. Described by Fortune.com as &#34;part personal essay, part fictional narrative and part meditation on the nature of work and life,&#34; &#34;The Monk and the Riddle&#34; is essential reading on the art of creating a life while making a living. &#39;Belongs in a category by itself...The best thing I&#39;ve read all year&#39; - &#34;San Francisco Examiner&#34;. &#39;A timely book&#39; - &#34;USA Today&#34;. &#39;A self-help manual and business fable rolled into one&#39; - &#34;The Times, London&#34;.</p><p>Prospective entrepreneurs may think they know everything there is to know about starting a business in Silicon Valley. They can draw up business plans, have meetings with venture capitalists, maybe even get funded and actually launch a start-up. However, in <i>The Monk and the Riddle</i>, Silicon Valley sage Randy Komisar reasons that's only half the equation for success. And it may not be the important half. Komisar has worked with a number of companies--Apple, LucasArts Entertainment (the gaming division of George Lucas's empire), and WebTV among them--and has come to a rather startling conclusion: if you can't see yourself doing this business for the rest of your life, don't start it. In other words, he wants to see passion and purpose in business, not just spreadsheets and a by-the-numbers business model.<p> To illustrate, Komisar takes the reader through a hypothetical Silicon Valley start-up, with an eager entrepreneur named Lenny trying to get funding for an online casket-selling business. As Komisar helps Lenny find the real purpose of the business, the passion behind the revenue projections, he reflects back on his life as an entrepreneur. Komisar emerges as a master storyteller, the kind of guy you'd feel honored to share a bottle of wine with. And you believe his conclusion: "When all is said and done, the journey is the reward." It's great if you've made billions on the journey, but the important thing is that you do something you can truly throw yourself into. <i>--Lou Schuler</i></p>"Belongs in a category by itself . . .

Isabel Parkman, a divorced American journalist, has fallen in love with a gifted and difficult Egyptian-American conductor. Shadowing her romance is the courtship of her great-grandparents Anna and Sharif nearly one hundred years before.<br><br> In 1900 the recently widows Anna Winterbourne left England for Egypt, an outpost of the Empire roiling with political sentiment. She soon found herself enraptured by the real Egypt and in love with Sharif Pasha al-Baroudi, an Egyptian nationalist. When Isabel, in an attempt to discover the truth behind her heritage, reenacts Anna&#x2019;s excursion to Egypt, the story of her great-grandparents unravels before her, revealing startling parallels for her own life.<br><br> Combining the romance and intricate narrative of a nineteenth-century novel with a very modern sense of culture and politics&#x2014;both sexual and international&#x2014;Ahdaf Soueif has created a thoroughly seductive and mesmerizing tale.</p><p>Ahdaf Soueif's <i>The Map of Love</i> is a massive family saga, a story that draws its readers into two moments in the complex, troubled history of modern Egypt. The story begins in 1977 in New York. There Isabel Parkman discovers an old trunk full of documents--some in English, some in Arabic--in her dying mother's apartment. Incapable of deciphering this stash by herself, she turns to Omar al-Ghamrawi, a man with whom she is falling in love. And Omar directs her in turn to his sister Amal in Cairo.<p> Together the two women begin to uncover the stories embedded in the journal of Lady Anna Winterbourne, who traveled to Egypt in 1900 and fell in love with Sharif Pasha al-Barudi, an Egyptian nationalist. To their surprise, they stumble across some unsuspected connections between their own families. Less surprising, perhaps, is the persistence of the very same issues that dogged their ancestors: colonialism, Egyptian nationalism, and the clash of cultures throughout the Middle East. The past, however, does offer some semblance of omniscience: </p><blockquote> That is the beauty of the past; there it lies on the table: journals, pictures, a candle-glass, a few books of history. You leave it and come back to it and it waits for you--unchanged. You can turn back the pages, look again at the beginning. You can leaf forward and know the end. And you tell the story that they, the people who lived it, could only tell in part. </blockquote> With its multiple narratives and ever-shifting perspectives, <i>The Map of Love</i> would seem to cast some doubt on even the most confident historian's version of events. Yet this subtle and reflective tale of love does suggest that the relations between individuals can (sometimes) make a difference. "I am in an English autumn in 1897," Amal confesses at one point, "and Anna's troubled heart lies open before me." Here, perhaps, is a hint about how we should read Soueif's staggering novel, using words as a means to travel through time, space, and identity. <i>--Vicky Lebeau</i>Booker Prize Finalist <br>"Sweeping and evocative--. An unconventional love story."--"The Times (London) <br>With her first novel, In the Eye of the Sun, Ahdaf Soueif garnered comparisons to Tolstoy, Flaubert, and George Eliot. In her latest novel, which was shortlisted for Britain's prestigious Booker Prize, she combines the romantic skill of the nineteenth-century novelists with a very modern sense of culture and politics--both sexual and international. <br>At either end of the twentieth century, two women fall in love with men outside their familiar worlds. In 1901, Anna Winterbourne, recently widowed, leaves England for Egypt, an outpost of the Empire roiling with nationalist sentiment. Far from the comfort of the British colony, she finds herself enraptured by the real Egypt and in love with Sharif Pasha al-Baroudi. Nearly a hundred years later, Isabel Parkman, a divorced American journalist and descendant of Anna and Sharif has fallen in love with Omar al-Ghamrawi, a gifted and difficult Egyptian-American conductor with his own passionate politics. In an attempt to understand her conflicting emotions and to discover the truth behind her heritage, Isabel, too, travels to Egypt, and enlists Omar's sister's help in unravelling the story of Anna and Sharif's love. <br>Joining the romance and intricate storytelling of A.S. Byatt's Possession and Michael Ondaatje's The English Patient, Ahdaf Soueif has once again created a mesmerizing tale of genuine eloquence and lasting importance.</p><h2>Treasury of Patchwork Borders: Full-Size Patterns for 76 Designs (Dover Quilting)</h2><p><p>There's no better finishing touch for the angular beauties of a patchwork quilt than just the right patchwork border, specially scaled to complement the central design.<br>This comprehensive and invaluable reference book by talented needlework designer Elizabeth Nyhan shows how to add that splendid final statement to full-size quilts, decorative throws, eye-catching wall hangings, heirloom-quality gifts, and more.

When the first European explorers began reporting their discovery of these enigmatic structures (over 400 years ago) no one knew who built them. No one seemed to know the meaning of the symbols, and the ritualistic purposes of the complex geometric earthen shapes were a complete mystery. That forgotten knowledge is explained by the decimation of Native American populations by explorers and gold-seeking Spanish conquistadores. Within a generation after the Spanish entered America, Native American populations decreased by over 90 percent from disease and war.It is now known that many ancient earthworks were used to assist souls of the dead in their journey to the sky world and the mysterious symbols were used in rituals by an elite ruling class of priests and chiefs.Souls journeyed to the west where they made a leap of faith to the sky. The souls then made a journey along the Milky Way until they reached the most important spot on the path. This was at the Great Rift of the Milky Way, where they encountered an enigmatic Adversary located at the Constellation of Cygnus. Path of Souls details this amazing death journey and how it was revealed in recent times by archaeologists. It is also thought that the newly revealed Native American death journey explains much about ancient Egyptian ideas of death.Where did these ideas about the death journey come from and when did they arrive in America? Who were the elite rulers of the Mound Builders? Hundreds of newspaper articles from the 1800s and early 1900s reported giant skeletons found in large stone tombs buried deep inside burial mounds. Were these tall leaders the elite? Today the Smithsonian asserts that there we no giants in the ancient world but in their actual published mound excavation reports, they detailed the discovery of many skeletons at least seven feet tall. Path of Souls explores all of these issues and is lavishly illustrated with over 150 maps, photos, and illustrations.</p><p></p><h2>Journey Through the Creation Museum</h2><p>Relive the awe-inspiring experience of touring the Creation Museum.

But Morphy was more than a player. He was a shy, retiring lawyer who had been taught that such games were no way to make a living. The strain of his fame and the pull of his domineering family led Morphy to set another precedent: chess madness. Morphy&#39;s mental descent after retiring from chess became a part of his lore, made all the more magnanimous by a spate of twentieth-century examples. The Pride and Sorrow of Chess tells the full known story of the life of Paul Morphy, from his privileged upbringing in New Orleans to his dominance of the chess world, to the later tragedy of his demise. This new edition of David Lawson&#39;s seminal work, still the principal source for all Morphy biographical presentations, also includes new biographical material about the biographer himself, telling the story of the author, his opus, and the previously unknown life that brought him to the research.</p><p>Thomas Aiello is an assistant professor of history at Valdosta State University.

These original techniques are presented in a highly accessible 'how-to' format that combines easy-to-follow text with a fresh, contemporary design that includes step-by-step photographs.<br><br>This is the first book ever to present the&nbsp;<i>authentic</i>&nbsp;ninja techniques in a highly accessible, illustrated 'how to' format. The shadowy figure of the ninja &#x2013; expert commando, secret agent, maverick who operates outside social norms &#x2013; continues to exert fascination in the West, yet much of what is presented as ninja fact today is distorted or wrong. Drawing on the scrolls created by historical Japanese ninjas (or&nbsp;<i>shinobi</i>, as they were then known), this book offers the real ninja teachings in 150 easy-to-follow, illustrated lessons designed to draw contemporary students of ninja straight into the world of these skilled spy-commandos. The truth about the ninja is so much more complex and intriguing than the Hollywood clich�s we know today. We may think, for example, of a ninja as being always garbed in black and fighting with 'throwing stars' but in fact, a ninja had clothes in different colours to serve as disguises for different times of day, and their arsenal of weaponry could include anything from poison, poison gas, pepper spray and fire-creating tools to swords, spears and knives (but no throwing stars). The 150 lessons in this book cover all the basics of ninja warcraft, including clever ideas for infiltrating an enemy compound (from wearing 'silent sandals' to faking passes and passwords), tactics for hiding and retreat (in the racoon dog retreat, a ninja will crouch low and halt, allowing the pursuer to collide with him at speed, whereupon the agent kills his enemy), and ways of crossing marshes and water (for example, with special shoes made of boards, or using a foldaway floating seat). The description is made all the more vivid by step-by-step photographs of the fighting techniques, diagrams outlining military tactics and beautiful samples of Japanese calligraphy.</p><p>Antony Cummins is the founder of the Historical Ninjutsu Research Team, which has previously published The Book of Ninja and The Book of Samurai (Watkins).

Six easy-to-read chapters introduce the main areas of theology that every lay minister ought to know: the notion of vocation, the doctrine of God, Jesus Christ, the Holy Spirit, church, and ministry. By sharing personal stories and simple examples, Edward Hahnenberg brings the Bible to life and dusts off ancient church doctrines&#x2014;revealing the many ways our tradition can inspire the work of lay ministers today.</p><p><p>Edward P.

Dr. Hahnenberg shares about his joy for "explaining things," which he recognizes as a charism, a gift of the Spirit to help others. Theology for Ministry illustrates that gift at its best. Weaving personal stories, references to pop culture, classical questions, some history, and a good intro to Catholic theology, this work is an invitation to think about ministry in light of the core convictions of our faith. No better place to ground the discernment of the vocation to Christian service than in the contemplation of the mysteries of the Triune God, Jesus, the Spirit, and the Church! Theology for Ministry is an excellent guide for such discernment.Hosffman Ospino, Boston College School of Theology and Ministry</i><br><br>"Here Ed Hahnenberg offers a well-informed, most engaging, delightfully written, and inspiring theology <i>for</i> ministry, crafted precisely for lay ministers.

The preposition <i>for</i> in the title is central: this work is at the service of lay ministers, inviting deep reflection on &#x2018;their own&#x2019; experience, and the theology which grounds it more deeply. Discussion questions encourage a pondering of experience, as well as the themes of vocation, God, Jesus Christ, the Spirit, the Church and ministry, each presented with great lucidity. Many sources inform Hahnenberg&#x2019;s work, including varied ecclesial documents, spiritual writers, theologians old and new, contemporary artists, but most especially stories of lay ministers (and his own stories) of the wellsprings of their faith and commitment to service. This is a rich resource for spiritual growth, and for a deepening of identity as lay ministers.&#x201d;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zeni Fox&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Professor of Pastoral Theology&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seton Hall University<br>&#x201c;In chapter 4, Hahnenberg says he has the gift of explaining things&#x2014;to which I say &#x2018;Amen!&#x2019; This book simply explains why we do what we do. The chapter titles: <i>Called ...By God ...Through Christ ... In the Spirit ... With Others ... For Others</i> provides a framework and a context in history, theology, and community for ministry.

She lives in England, where she is at work on her next book.</strong> <br> <p> Writing <em>Twenties Girl</em> was like going on my own magical mystery tour. My U.S. editor Susan Kamil had once said casually, "You should write a ghost story one day." This comment stayed with me for years. I loved the idea, but didn't know who my ghost could be. I've always loved the glamour and spirit of the 1920s, and the idea came to me of a flapper ghost. A feisty, fun, glamorous girl who adored to dance and drink cocktails and get her own way. I wanted her to be a determined character who would blast into the life of someone with no warning and cause havoc. I then decided she should haunt a thoroughly modern girl, with all the culture clashes and comedy that would bring.<br></p> <p>Having come up with this idea I loved it, so it then remained to plunge myself into 1920s research, which was no hardship at all, as I find the era fascinating. I researched vintage make-up, vintage dresses, read fiction from the period, investigated 1920s slang, and tried to channel as much I could of those feisty flappers who cut their hair short (shock!), smoked cigarettes in public (shock!), had sex (shock!) and generally rebelled in all the outrageous ways they could.</p> <p>The book isn't a period piece though. It's a modern story about two girls and their sparky friendship, right here in the 21st century. One of them just happens to be a ghost from the 1920s. It's a quest, a romance, and a coming of age... and above all a comedy. It's no exaggeration to say that writing the character of Sadie made me look at life differently, and I hope some readers feel the same way. <em>&#x2014;Sophie Kinsella</em></p> <strong>Sophie Kinsella on Jewelry in <em>Twenties Girl</em></strong> <p>When I was at college I had a bicycle which I rarely used and which sat, week after week, in the bike racks. One day I went to get it out--and found a diamante necklace twined round the spokes of the front wheel. It was an old, vintage-style necklace, one of the prettiest things I&#x2019;d ever seen. On my bike! How had it got there? Had someone borrowed my bike and dropped it? Was it a romantic gift from a secret admirer? (Ok, unlikely...)</p> <p>I put up a notice in college--but got no claimers. It was mine! I wore that necklace over and over--and felt as though it had somehow magical qualities. Would it have felt so magical if it were a scarf or a hat or a purse? I don&#x2019;t think so.</p> <p>Jewelry has a magic all its own. Precious stones have always attracted legends, myths, crimes, lust. Quite sane women will go to pieces at the sight of a big enough diamond. Even as a tiny child I was fascinated by beads, jewels, tiaras...anything that glittered. And, like books, I find it hard to give pieces of jewelry away, even after I&#x2019;ve stopped wearing them.</p> <p>The biggest symbol of jewelry is love. Whose heart doesn&#x2019;t stop on being presented with a little velvet box? Who secretly doesn&#x2019;t crave a diamond, however teeny? Of course true love is putting out the rubbish every night...but that won&#x2019;t make you gasp and tilt your hand to catch the facets of light.</p> <p>When I was writing <i>Twenties Girl</i> I knew I needed to give Sadie, my ghost character, a mission. There was something in the world she still wanted--and it didn&#x2019;t take long to decide on jewelry. A ring seemed too obvious...bracelets too inconsequential...but a necklace was perfect. I wanted it to be tactile, romantic, and the kind of piece you could imagine wearing with anything. Guided by research into jewelry of the 1920s, I conjured up in my head a long necklace of glimmering yellow glass beads, with a dragonfly pendant set with rhinestones. Not priceless....but special. I could imagine Sadie twirling the beads as she danced, I could imagine her gathering them and letting them drop. I could see it as an iconic, timeless piece. </p> <p>A dragonfly seemed a perfect emblem for Sadie, too--beautiful, fragile, and darting around like quicksilver. The dragonfly symbol has different meanings for different cultures--for some it&#x2019;s a symbol of change, for others it represents the subconscious. In Japanese paintings, dragonflies can mean new light and joy. To some Native Americans they&#x2019;re the souls of the dead. All of these interpretations are perfect for the character of Sadie--a ghost who needs to "move on" and for whom the dragonfly necklace has a meaning all its own.</p> <p>The more I wrote about Sadie&#x2019;s dragonfly necklace the more it came to mean to both her and me--and I hope it does to readers, too.</p><b>Sophie Kinsella&nbsp;</b>is the author of the bestselling Shopaholic series, as well as the novels&nbsp;<i>Can You Keep A Secret?, The Undomestic Goddess, Remember Me?, Twenties Girl,</i>&nbsp;<i>I&#x2019;ve Got Your Number,&nbsp;</i>and<i>&nbsp;Wedding Night</i>.

Depending on who&#x2019;s doing the talking, the history of Rome serves as either a triumphal call to action or a dire warning of imminent collapse. In Are We Rome? the esteemed editor and author Cullen Murphy reveals a wide array of similarities between the two empires: the blinkered, insular culture of our capitals; the debilitating effect of bribery in public life; the paradoxical issue of borders; and the weakening of the body politic through various forms of privatization. Murphy persuasively argues that we most resemble Rome in the burgeoning corruption of our government and in our arrogant ignorance of the world outside -- two things that must be changed if we are to avoid Rome&#x2019;s fate.</p><p>Cullen Murphy is the editor at large at <i>Vanity Fair</i> and the former managing editor of the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i>. He is the author of&nbsp;<i>Are We Rome?,</i>&nbsp;<i>The Word According to Eve</i>, and the essay collection <i>Just Curious</i>.Lurid images of America as a new Roman Empire&#x2014;either striding the globe or tottering toward collapse, or both&#x2014;are fashionable among pundits of all stripes these days. <i>Vanity Fair</i> editor Murphy (<i>The World According to Eve</i>) gives the trope a more restrained and thoughtful reading. He allows that, with its robust democracy, dynamic economy and technological wizardry, America is a far cry from Rome's static slave society. But he sees a number of parallels: like Rome, America is a vast, multicultural state, burdened with an expensive and overstretched military, uneasy about its porous borders, with a messianic sense of global mission and a solipsistic tendency to misunderstand and belittle foreign cultures. Some of the links Murphy draws, like his comparison of barbarian invaders of the late Empire to foreign corporations buying up American assets, are purely metaphorical. But others, especially his likening of the corrupt Roman patronage system to America's mania for privatizing government services&#x2014;a "deflection of public purpose by private interest"&#x2014;are specific and compelling. Murphy wears his erudition lightly and delivers a lucid, pithy and perceptive study in comparative history, with some sharp points. <i>(May 10)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Amy Harper Bellafonte.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The day Amy was born, her mother, Jeanette, was nineteen years old. Jeanette named her baby Amy for her own mother, who&#x2019;d died when Jeanette was little, and gave her the middle name Harper for Harper Lee, the lady who&#x2019;d written <i>To Kill a Mockingbird,</i> Jeanette&#x2019;s favorite book&#x2014;truth be told, the only book she&#x2019;d made it all the way through in high school. She might have named her Scout, after the little girl in the story, because she wanted her little girl to grow up like that, tough and funny and wise, in a way that she, Jeanette, had never managed to be. But Scout was a name for a boy, and she didn&#x2019;t want her daughter to have to go around her whole life explaining something like that.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Amy&#x2019;s father was a man who came in one day to the restaurant where Jeanette had waited tables since she turned sixteen, a diner everyone called the Box, because it looked like one: like a big chrome shoe box sitting off the county road, backed by fields of corn and beans, nothing else around for miles except a self-serve car wash, the kind where you had to put coins into the machine and do all the work yourself. The man, whose name was Bill Reynolds, sold combines and harvesters, big things like that, and he was a sweet talker who told Jeanette as she poured his coffee and then later, again and again, how pretty she was, how he liked her coal-black hair and hazel eyes and slender wrists, said it all in a way that sounded like he meant it, not the way boys in school had, as if the words were just something that needed to get said along the way to her letting them do as they liked. He had a big car, a new Pontiac, with a dashboard that glowed like a spaceship and leather seats creamy as butter. She could have loved that man, she thought, really and truly loved him. But he stayed in town only a few days, and then went on his way. When she told her father what had happened, he said he wanted to go looking for him, make him live up to his responsibilities. But what Jeanette knew and didn&#x2019;t say was that Bill Reynolds was married, a married man; he had a family in Lincoln, all the way clean over in Nebraska. He&#x2019;d even showed her the pictures in his wallet of his kids, two little boys in baseball uniforms, Bobby and Billy. So no matter how many times her father asked who the man was that had done this to her, she didn&#x2019;t say. She didn&#x2019;t even tell him the man&#x2019;s name.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And the truth was, she didn&#x2019;t mind any of it, not really: not the being pregnant, which was easy right until the end, nor the delivery itself, which was bad but fast, nor, especially, having a baby, her little Amy. To tell Jeanette he&#x2019;d decided to forgive her, her father had done up her brother&#x2019;s old bedroom as a nursery, carried down the old baby crib from the attic, the one Jeanette herself had slept in, years ago; he&#x2019;d gone with Jeanette, in the last months before Amy came, to the Walmart to pick out some things she&#x2019;d need, like pajamas and a little plastic tub and a wind-up mobile to hang over the crib. He&#x2019;d read a book that said that babies needed things like that, things to look at so their little brains would turn on and begin to work properly. From the start Jeanette always thought of the baby as &#x201c;her,&#x201d; because in her heart she wanted a girl, but she knew that wasn&#x2019;t the sort of thing you should say to anyone, not even to yourself. She&#x2019;d had a scan at the hospital over in Cedar Falls and asked the woman, a lady in a flowered smock who was running the little plastic paddle over Jeanette&#x2019;s stomach, if she could tell which it was; but the woman laughed, looking at the pictures on the TV of Jeanette&#x2019;s baby, sleeping away inside her, and said, <i>Hon, this baby&#x2019;s shy. Sometimes you can tell and others you can&#x2019;t, and this is one of those times.</i> So Jeanette didn&#x2019;t know, which she decided was fine with her, and after she and her father had emptied out her brother&#x2019;s room and taken down his old pennants and posters&#x2014;Jose Canseco, a music group called Killer Picnic, the Bud Girls&#x2014;and seen how faded and banged up the walls were, they painted it a color the label on the can called &#x201c;Dreamtime,&#x201d; which somehow was both pink and blue at once&#x2014;good whatever the baby turned out to be. Her father hung a wallpaper border along the edge of the ceiling, a repeating pattern of ducks splashing in a puddle, and cleaned up an old maple rocking chair he&#x2019;d found at the auction hall, so that when Jeanette brought the baby home, she&#x2019;d have a place to sit and hold her.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The baby came in summer, the girl she&#x2019;d wanted and named Amy Harper Bellafonte; there seemed no point in using the name Reynolds, the last name of a man Jeanette guessed she&#x2019;d never see again and, now that Amy was here, no longer wanted to. And Bellafonte: you couldn&#x2019;t do better than a name like that. It meant &#x201c;beautiful fountain,&#x201d; and that&#x2019;s what Amy was. Jeanette fed and rocked and changed her, and when Amy cried in the middle of the night because she was wet or hungry or didn&#x2019;t like the dark, Jeanette stumbled down the hall to her room, no matter what the hour was or how tired she felt from working at the Box, to pick her up and tell her she was there, she would always be there, you cry and I&#x2019;ll come running, that&#x2019;s a deal between us, you and me, forever and ever, my little Amy Harper Bellafonte. And she would hold and rock her until dawn began to pale the window shades and she could hear birds singing in the branches of the trees outside.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Then Amy was three and Jeanette was alone. Her father had died, a heart attack they told her, or else a stroke. It wasn&#x2019;t the kind of thing anyone needed to check. Whatever it was, it hit him early one winter morning as he was walking to his truck to drive to work at the elevator; he had just enough time to put down his coffee on the fender before he fell over and died, never spilling a drop. She still had her job at the Box, but the money wasn&#x2019;t enough now, not for Amy or any of it, and her brother, in the Navy somewhere, didn&#x2019;t answer her letters. <i>God invented Iowa,</i> he always said, <i>so people could leave it and never come back.</i> She wondered what she would do.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Then one day a man came into the diner. It was Bill Reynolds. He was different, somehow, and the change was no good. The Bill Reynolds she remembered&#x2014;and she had to admit she still thought of him from time to time, about little things mostly, like the way his sandy hair flopped over his forehead when he talked, or how he blew over his coffee before he sipped it, even when it wasn&#x2019;t hot anymore&#x2014;there was something about him, a kind of warm light from inside that you wanted to be near. It reminded her of those little plastic sticks that you snapped so the liquid inside made them glow. This was the same man, but the glow was gone. He looked older, thinner. She saw he hadn&#x2019;t shaved or combed his hair, which was greasy and standing all whichaway, and he wasn&#x2019;t wearing a pressed polo like before but just an ordinary work shirt like the ones her father had worn, untucked and stained under the arms. He looked like he&#x2019;d spent all night out in the weather, or in a car somewhere. He caught her eye at the door and she followed him to a booth in back.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x2014;<i>What are you doing here?</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x2014;<i>I left her,</i> he said, and as he looked at where she stood, she smelled beer on his breath, and sweat, and dirty clothes. <i>I&#x2019;ve gone and done it, Jeanette. I left my wife. I&#x2019;m a free man.</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x2014;<i>You drove all this way to tell me that?</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x2014;<i>I&#x2019;ve thought about you.</i> He cleared his throat. <i>A lot. I&#x2019;ve thought about us.</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x2014;<i>What us? There ain&#x2019;t no us. You can&#x2019;t come in like you&#x2019;re doing and say you&#x2019;ve been thinking about us.</i></p><p><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p>He sat up straight. <i>&#x2014;Well, I&#x2019;m doing it. I&#x2019;m doing it right now.</i></p><p><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>&#x2014;It&#x2019;s busy in here, can&#x2019;t you see that? I can&#x2019;t be talking to you like this. You&#x2019;ll have to order something.</i></p><p><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>&#x2014;Fine,</i> he answered, but he didn&#x2019;t look at the menu on the wall, just kept his eyes on her. <i>I&#x2019;ll have a cheeseburger. A cheeseburger and a Coke.</i></p><p><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p>As she wrote down the order and the words swam in her vision, she realized she had started to cry. She felt like she hadn&#x2019;t slept in a month, a year. The weight of exhaustion was held up only by the thinnest sliver of her will. There was a time when she&#x2019;d wanted to do something with her life&#x2014;cut hair, maybe, get her certificate, open a little shop, move to a real city, like Chicago or Des Moines, rent an apartment, have friends. She&#x2019;d always held in her mind a picture of herself sitting in a restaurant, a coffee shop but nice; it was fall, and cold outside, and she was alone at a small table by the window, reading a book. On her table was a steaming mug of tea. She would look up to the window to see the people on the street of the city she was in, hustling to and fro in their heavy coats and hats, and see her own face there, too, reflected in the window, hovering over the image of all the people outside. But as she stood there, these ideas seemed like they belonged to a different person entirely. Now there was Amy, sick half the time with a cold or a stomach thing she&#x2019;d gotten at the ratty day care where she spent the days while Jeanette was working at the Box, and her father dead just like that, so fast it was as if he&#x2019;d fallen through a trapdoor on the surface of the earth, and Bill Reynolds sitting at the table like he&#x2019;d just stepped out for a second, not four years.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x2014;<i>Why are you doing this to me?</i></p><p><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p>He held her eyes with his own a long moment and touched the top of her hand.&#x2014;<i>Meet me later.</i> <i>Please.</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He ended up living in the house with her and Amy. She couldn&#x2019;t say if she had invited him to do this or if it had just somehow happened. Either way, she was instantly sorry. This Bill Reynolds: who was he really? He&#x2019;d left his wife and boys, Bobby and Billy in their baseball suits, all of it behind in Nebraska. The Pontiac was gone, and he had no job either; that had ended, too. The economy the way it was, he explained, nobody was buying a goddamn thing. He said he had a plan, but the only plan that she could see seemed to be him sitting in the house doing nothing for Amy or even cleaning up the breakfast dishes, while she worked all day at the Box. He hit her the first time after he&#x2019;d been living there three months; he was drunk, and once he did it, he burst out crying and said, over and over, how sorry he was. He was on his knees, blubbering, like <i>she&#x2019;d</i> done something to <i>him.</i> She had to understand, he was saying, how hard it all was, all the changes in his life, it was more than a man, any man, could take. He loved her, he was sorry, nothing like that would happen again, ever. He <i>swore</i> it. Not to her and not to Amy. And in the end, she heard herself saying she was sorry too.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He&#x2019;d hit her over money; when winter came, and she didn&#x2019;t have enough money in her checking account to pay the heating oil man, he hit her again.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x2014;<i>Goddamnit, woman. Can&#x2019;t you see I&#x2019;m in a situation here?</i></p><p><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p>She was on the kitchen floor, holding the side of her head. He&#x2019;d hit her hard enough to lift her off her feet. Funny, now that she was down there she saw how dirty the floor was, filthy and stained, with clumps of dust and who-knew-what all rowed against the base of the cabinets where you couldn&#x2019;t usually see. Half her mind was noticing this while the other half said, You aren&#x2019;t thinking straight, Jeanette; Bill hit you and knocked a wire loose, so now you&#x2019;re worrying over the dust. Something funny was happening with the way the world sounded, too. Amy was watching television upstairs, on the little set in her room, but Jeanette could hear it like it was playing inside her head, Barney the purple dinosaur and a song about brushing your teeth; and then from far away, she heard the sound of the oil truck pulling away, its engine grinding as it turned out of the drive and headed down the county road.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x2014;<i>It ain&#x2019;t your house,</i> she said.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x2014;<i>You&#x2019;re right about that.</i> Bill took a bottle of Old Crow from over the sink and poured some in a jelly jar, though it was only ten o&#x2019;clock in the morning. He sat at the table but didn&#x2019;t cross his legs like he meant to get comfortable. <i>Ain&#x2019;t my oil, either.</i></p><p><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p>Jeanette rolled over and tried to stand but couldn&#x2019;t. She watched him drink for a minute.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x2014;<i>Get out.</i></p><p><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p>He laughed, shaking his head, and took a sip of whiskey.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x2014;<i>That&#x2019;s funny,</i> he said. <i>You telling me that from the floor like you are.</i></p><p><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p>&#x2014;<i>I mean what I say. Get out.</i></p><p><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p>Amy came into the room. She was holding the stuffed bunny she still carried everywhere, and wearing a pair of overalls, the good ones Jeanette had bought her at the outlet mall, the OshKosh B&#x2019;Gosh, with the strawberries embroidered on the bib. One of the straps had come undone and was flopping at her waist. Jeanette realized Amy must have done this herself, because she had to go to the bathroom.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x2014;<i>You&#x2019;re on the floor, Mama.</i></p><p><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p>&#x2014;<i>I&#x2019;m okay, honey.</i> She got to her feet to show her. Her left ear was ringing a little, like in a cartoon, birds flying around her head. She saw there was a little blood, too, on her hand; she didn&#x2019;t know where this had come from. She picked Amy up and did her best to smile. <i>See? Mama just took a spill, that&#x2019;s all.</i> <i>You need to go, honey? You need to use the potty?</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>&#x2014;Look at you,</i> Bill was saying. <i>Will you look at yourself?</i> He shook his head again and drank. <i>You stupid twat.</i> <i>She probably ain&#x2019;t even mine.</i></p><p><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p>&#x2014;<i>Mama,</i> the girl said and pointed, <i>you cut yourself.</i> <i>Your nose is cut.</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And whether it was what she&#x2019;d heard or the blood, the little girl began to cry.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x2014;<i>See what you done?</i> Bill said, and to Amy, <i>Come on now. Ain&#x2019;t no big thing, sometimes folks argue, that&#x2019;s just how it is.</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x2014;<i>I&#x2019;m telling you again, just leave.</i></p></p><h2>Messages From the Light Meditation Deck</h2><p>This visionary deck delivers inspirational messages from the light that help illuminate ordinary things in life with fresh, new insights.

I remember moving, so I try to move.<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t move,&#x201d; someone says, so I stop. &#x201c;Do you know where you are?&#x201d; I try to answer but find I can&#x2019;t speak because there&#x2019;s something in my mouth. I shake my head. I remember gestures and signs. Something about memorizing them and being tested on them. &#x201c;Do you know who you are?&#x201d; I search that part of my memory and find it a void. Not small, or undeveloped, but empty. Emptied. I shake my head again.<br> <br>&#x201c;Good,&#x201d; the voice says. &#x201c;Close your eyes.&#x201d; I can&#x2019;t remember ever choosing for myself, so I do as I&#x2019;m told.

It will go away.&#x201d;<br> <br>But what if I don&#x2019;t want&#x2014;<br> <br>There&#x2019;s a bright flash. And a noise like thunder. And everything shakes.<br> <br>Her hands blur in front of my eyes.<br> <br>What are your directives?<br> <br>I only nod. I can&#x2019;t answer. I&#x2019;m holding my rifle with both hands.<br> <br>The heel of her hand connects hard with my forehead, slamming me back against the metal wall behind me.<br> <br>Look! Listen!<br> <br>I nod. Nod. Nod.<br> <br>Yes. Yes. Yes.<br> <br>Dart each one. Leave them where they fall. Understand?<br> <br>Yes. Yes.<br> <br>I know this anyway. The directives are humming in my mind like a swollen river churning over rocks.<br> <br>You must obey.<br> <br>Yes.<br> <br>I am obedience. I am malice. I grip my rifle tightly, fingers and hands absorbing the weight of it, the feel of the trigger, the faint vibrations.<br> <br>Then I am running behind her, my hand on her shoulder, clanging over steel and stone as we&#x2019;re consumed by heat and fire and noise. At first all I hear are weapons. Our precise ones and their brutal, noisy ones. But under that is another sound.<br> <br>Screaming. They are screaming. I put my hands over my ears.<br> <br>What are you doing?<br> <br>I nod. Yes.<br> <br>Stupid defective low rank mud for brains.<br> <br>Yes.<br> <br>She drags me, pulling my hands away from my ears. Ahead of us on the road, emerging from the flames and smoke, a human vehicle appears. I fumble for my rifle, but she has already fired; the dart punctures the glass and the face of the driver. There&#x2019;s a screech as the car swerves toward us, and I&#x2019;m leaping for it, pushing it away into a high wall as she stands there, undaunted, her rifle still raised.<br> <br>Break it, she signs with one hand, marching toward me.<br> <br>I turn and drive my fists through the window of the door. Inside, small humans scream.<br> <br>Dart them, she says.<br> <br>They scream and scream. I can&#x2019;t move.<br> <br>MOVE!<br> <br>I step back as she raises her rifle. Thunk. Thunk. Thunk.<br> <br>The screaming stops. She drags me away before I can take a breath.<br> <br>Follow me! Her hands slash through the air. Obey me!<br> <br>We run between two high buildings, emerging into chaos. Hundreds of humans with guns and shields fire at our lines. Bullets bounce off my back as she leads me into the fray. Behind the humans with shields others are pushing and running, trying to get into a building. Our line breaks, and we follow a group that plows right through the shields and guns. The armed humans fall around us. One of them gets its fingers around her arm, pulling her rifle down. I grab the human by the neck and fling it away, watching it tumble into a heap with others.<br> <br>Good, she says.<br> <br>Her praise enlivens me. As the humans pour in through the door of the building, I leap up and tear open a window. She clambers ahead of me, and I dive after her, landing among the screaming humans as they scatter, desperately scrambling for exits. Her rifle whines as she darts them, one by one. When she stops, there are a dozen humans motionless on the floor.<br> <br>Good, I say, though I feel dizzy and hot. I&#x2019;m burning. I sway on my feet, reaching for her.<br> <br>Think cold, she says.<br> <br>Yes. I do what she says and feel my body cool down and my head clear. Malice is cold. Obedience is cold. I am cold.<br> <br>There&#x2019;s a huge noise outside, one of their crude weapons. The force of the explosion blows the remaining windows inward. Instinctively, I pull her under me, curling my back over her as the glass tinkles down around us. She shoves me away, stepping over bodies, and turns back to the door the humans came in.<br> <br>Outside is smoke and flames. Those of our soldiers who don&#x2019;t lie in pieces among the darted humans stagger to their feet. A transport swoops down, hovering over the carnage. She pulls me away from the transport, back along the ruined road. Over our heads a human aircraft explodes, raining debris. She worms away from me before I can shield her and stands with her arms out, defiant, her face turned to the explosion in the sky as burning embers drift down around us like&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br> <br>Over the roar of our transport and the screams of fleeing humans I hear something else, a kind of whistle. A flash of light shoots past us and cracks into the side of a human car, shattering the windows. She takes one step toward the car before I can stop her.<br> <br>Then I&#x2019;m falling. Shards of metal careen at me before I land. My arm twists up to block one, another smacks into my face. I hit the ground hard and sink.<br> <br>Obedience. Anger. I&#x2019;m swimming in it. My insides twist and churn and thoughts scurry out of the holes in my mind.<br> <br>Snow&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br> <br>A sunset&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the smell of&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br> <br>It&#x2019;s just residual neural impulses. Pain stomps on them, killing them.<br> <br>Breathe.<br> <br>I blink away the blood in my eyes. She&#x2019;s hanging over me, kneeling by my head.<br> <br>Breathe. Obey.<br> <br>I try. The air is too thick. I&#x2019;m choking. My head is open and everything is escaping. And I&#x2019;m on fire.<br> <br>Cold. Think cold. Obey.<br> <br>Are you damaged? I sign with one hand. The other hand is not working.<br> <br>No. Breathe again.<br> <br>I obey. Each breath is like a flaming knife. I turn my head to the side and let my thoughts drip out. I&#x2019;m forgetting everything. I&#x2019;ve forgotten how to hold on to thoughts. I put my good hand over the hole in my head to try&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br> <br>Stop. Be still.<br> <br>She touches my face. Her hand is warm and firm.?You will live, she signs. Keep breathing.<br> <br>The agony of the next breath erases everything.<br> <br>My eyes snap open in the dark. The battle is over. We are alone now in the building with the darted humans. Silver moonlight through the broken window outlines her as she moves.<br> <br>You scared me, Eighth, she says. I thought you would die.<br> <br>That makes me feel so happy that the pain becomes meaningless.</p><h2>Oriki</h2><p>Oriki&nbsp;is the praise poetry and invocations of the Yoruba people.

With their husbands, brothers, and fathers marching off to war, either on the battlefield or in the halls of Congress, the women of Washington joined the cause as well. And more women went to the Capital City to enlist as nurses, supply organizers, relief workers, and journalists. Many risked their lives making munitions in a highly flammable arsenal, toiled at the Treasury Department printing greenbacks to finance the war, and plied their needlework skills at The Navy Yard&#x2014;once the sole province of men&#x2014;to sew canvas gunpowder bags for the troops.</p><p>Cokie Roberts chronicles these women's increasing independence, their political empowerment, their indispensable role in keeping the Union unified through the war, and in helping heal it once the fighting was done. She concludes that the war not only changed Washington, it also forever changed the place of women.</p><p>Sifting through newspaper articles, government records, and private letters and diaries&#x2014;many never before published&#x2014;Roberts brings the war-torn capital into focus through the lives of its formidable women.</p></p><p><p>&#x201c;Roberts is a gifted narrator of Civil War history, weaving the experiences and perspectives of the women into a fresh and illuminating account of key battles and events.&#x201d;&#x2014;<em>Washington Post</em></p><p>&#x201c;Cokie Roberts regularly dissects the power dynamics of modern-day Washington. As an author, though, she&#x2019;s demonstrated a special regard for the farther reaches of American history and its behind-the-scenes players.&#x201d;&#x2014;<em>New York Times Book Review</em> </p><p>With the outbreak of the Civil War, the small, social Southern town of Washington, D.C., found itself caught between warring sides in a battle to determine the future of the United States. Drawing on newspaper articles, government records, and private letters and diaries, many never before published, <em>Capital Dames</em> introduces the resilient and remarkable women of Washington.</p><p>As the war remodeled the city first into an immense Union Army camp and later a hospital, women enlisted as nurses, supply organizers, relief workers, and journalists. Many risked their lives making munitions, toiled at the Treasury Department printing greenbacks to finance the war, and sewed canvas gunpowder bags for the troops at the Navy Yard. In this compelling story of a Southern society town&#x2019;s transformation into a center of national power, Roberts shows us how the Capital City spread its influence as a result of the war and how the women who had once been self-described &#x201c;belles&#x201d; evolved into purposeful activists, writers, and organizers, changing forever the role of women in American society.</p><p>Cokie Roberts is a political commentator for ABC News and NPR. She has won countless awards and in 2008 was named a &#x201c;Living Legend&#x201d; by the Library of Congress.

He recovered, returned to fieldwork and devoted the next several decades to understanding and protecting these often-maligned giants. He has spent thousands of hours among wild grizzles in Yosemite and Yellowstone national parks, Alberta, coastal British Columbia, and along Brooks River in Alaska's Katmai National Park, where hundreds of people gather to watch dozens of grizzlies feast on salmon. His research has centered on how bears respond to people and each other, with a focus on how to keep humans and bears safe. <br><br>Drawn from his decades of experience, One of Us: A Biologist's Walk Among Bears explodes myths that depict grizzlies as bloodthirsty beasts that "kill for pleasure" and reveals the intelligent, adaptable side of these astonishingly social animals. He also explains their pivotal role in maintaining and protecting their fragile ecosystems. Accordingly, Gilbert pulls no punches when outlining threats to bear conservation. Most importantly, this book extolls a new way of appreciating grizzly bears, the same way we regard wolves, whales, chimpanzees, and gorillas....</p><p>Born in Kingston, Ontario, Barrie Gilbert graduated with a degree in biology from Queen&#39;s University, going on to earn a PhD in zoology from Duke University. After a stint as an Alberta wildlife research biologist, he joined the faculty of Utah State University, where he taught courses on animal behavior, wildlife management and endangered species. His research interests include human-wildlife interactions, especially the three species of North American bears; studies of dolphin communication; and ungulate behavior. Since retiring, Dr. Gilbert has focused on bringing ecological insights to conservation of threatened species and habitats. His hobbies include photography, sailing, mountain biking, and physical fitness....<b>"Barrie Gilbert is probably the most experienced, credible grizzly bear biologist working on the planet today... Here is&nbsp;<i>the&nbsp;grizzly book, packed with incredible knowledge, to trust."<br>~&nbsp;<em>Doug Peacock, renowned nature writer and grizzly bear expert</em></i></b><br><br>"When a person's first encounter with a creature is a disfiguring mauling from which he miraculously survives, it would be reasonable to expect what follows would be lifelong fear, even hatred. But this book is written by such a man, yet lifelong fascination, even admiration remained his career path. Knowing that, you'd expect such a person who could survive and remain fascinated to be exceptionally level-headed. And he is. If he then wrote a book about his life with bears, you'd expect that book to be incredibly insightful, thorough, and yet lacking exaggeration. This book you're holding is that book. Barrie Gilbert considers bears to be 'the chimpanzees of the carnivore world.' And in this book, one very intelligent creature has met another, their lives have intertwined, and this work is the fascinating result."<br>~ Carl Safina, author of&nbsp;<i>Beyond Words: What Animals Think and Feel</i><br><br>"How amazing to read in a single enthralled sitting the work of a lifetime. Dr. Barrie Gilbert, like the Craigheads and Muries, has spent a lifetime being with bears in the wilderness, and in so doing has learned about not just bears, but all the comings and goings of a world that is intimately connected to them in every season. I've been waiting for this book from him for more than forty years. As mythical as the tale of Jonah and the whale, it does not disappoint. This book crackles with intelligence and its more advanced counterpart, wisdom."<br>~ Rick Bass, novelist, nature writer, activist&nbsp;</p><h2>The Subversion of Christianity (Jacques Ellul Legacy)</h2><p>Pointing to the many contradictions between the Bible and the practice of the church, Jacques Ellul asserts in this provocative and stimulating book that what we today call Christianity is actually far removed from the revelation of God. Successive generations have reinterpreted Scripture and modeled it after their own cultures, thus moving society further from the truth of the original gospel. The church also perverted the gospel message, for instead of simply doing away with pagan practice and belief, it reconstituted the sacred, set up its own religious forms, and thus resacralized the world. Ellul develops several areas in which this perversion is most obvious, including the church&#39;s emphasis on moralism and its teaching in the political sphere. The heart of the problem, he says, is that we have not accepted the fact that Christianity is a scandal; we attempt to make it acceptable and easy--and thus pervert its true message. Ultimately, however, Ellul remains hopeful. For, in spite of all that has been done to subvert the message of God, the Holy Spirit continues to move in the world. &#34;Christianity,&#34; writes Ellul, &#34;never carries the day decisively against Christ.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>Freshwater Fishes of Texas: A Field Guide (River Books, Sponsored by The Meadows Center for Water and the Environment, Texas State University)</h2><p>Containing habitat information, physical descriptions, photographs, and range maps for more than 150 species of freshwater fishes that can be found in Texas, this field guide is an indispensable reference and research tool for ichthyologists, professional fisheries biologists, amateur naturalists, and anglers alike.&nbsp;The introductory section offers an illustrated guide to the common counts and measurements used for fish identification; a brief explanation of fish phylogeny; and a scientific key to help identify the fish families in Texas.&nbsp;The book includes species accounts of native and introduced fishes found in the freshwaters of Texas.

The psychologically complex and morally ambiguous tales of love and adultery, dream and reality, desire and death in <i>Night Games</i> prove Schnitzler to be fully the equal of his great contemporaries Kafka, Rilke, and Musil, and justify Freud's praise of his knowledge of depth psychology. The collection includes powerful early works such as "The Dead Are Silent" and "Geronimo and His Brother" as well as late masterpieces such as "Night Games" and "Dream Story." Schnitzler creates memorable characters and makes original and masterful use of inner monologue, "stream of consciousness," and unrealiable narrator-techniques that he was among the first, if not the first, to use-to explore the complexities of their inner lives even as he delineates their social world with elegance and wit. The results are comic, tragic, powerful, and psychologically compelling tales of love, sex, and death that often surprise. They are as fresh and relevant to us today, a century later, as when they were first written.</p><p>Arthur Schnitzler (1862&#x2013;1931), Austrian physician, dramatist, and novelist, was among the most sophisticated writers of his time. Margret Schaefer, who has taught at the University of California, Berkeley, and the University of Illinois, Chicago, has written on Wilde, von Kleist, and Kafka as well as on the history of psychoanalysis and psychology. She lives in Berkeley, California.

They insist that I try everything on my plate. That I eat what they eat. No chicken tenders off the kids&#x2019; menu for me. If they have calamari or chicken livers, that&#x2019;s what I have to eat, too.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And the truth is: I&#x2019;m a pretty good eater. Growing up in the Bay Area, you get to try a lot of different kinds of cuisine. I&#x2019;ve had Indian, Burmese, Mexican, Chinese, Peruvian, Vietnamese, you name it. I even like the raw-fish kind of sushi.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My parents agree that I&#x2019;ve never been really picky except when it comes to one thing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Mushrooms.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The first time I tried a mushroom I was in kindergarten. My parents are divorced, but they&#x2019;ve always stayed good friends, and we have family dinner once a week.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We were at a favorite Italian restaurant and my mother had ordered a pasta dish for the table--ravioli. I loved pasta of all kinds, so I was happy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Then I took a bite.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To my horror, instead of creamy cheese being in the cute pasta pocket, there were weird brown chunks. It tasted awful. Like dirt.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;What is this?&#x201d; I asked my mom.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Mushroom ravioli. Don&#x2019;t you like it?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I shook my head. I definitely did not like it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My parents seemed a little disappointed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The second time I tried a mushroom, it was at a Chinese restaurant. We&#x2019;d gone to see a play and it was late and I was really hungry. My parents talked me into ordering a chicken-and-mushroom dish.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Try new things, they told me.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But this time the mushroom had a horrible texture: rubbery and slimy. What was the deal with mushrooms, anyway? Why were they so gross?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I didn&#x2019;t starve (I ate the plain rice and fortune cookies), but I was annoyed. At the mushrooms. And at myself for trying them again.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Then and there I resolved never to eat a mushroom again.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That&#x2019;s when the Mushroom War started.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Because my parents took it as a personal challenge that I didn&#x2019;t like mushrooms. They started putting them in everything. They put mushrooms in stir-fry and lasagna and salad. I guess they figured I&#x2019;d cave and eat them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But there was no way I was making that mistake again.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Eventually, my parents gave up and I won the Mushroom War. They moved on to brussels sprouts, which didn&#x2019;t deserve such a bad rap, in my opinion.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As the years went by, they would occasionally serve me something with mushrooms.

Because I know just how they feel. Middle school is like jail: the food is terrible, you&#x2019;re forced to exercise, and it&#x2019;s the same boring routine every day.

It&#x2019;s also fine if you want to buddy up with another student and enter as a team.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Even though I&#x2019;ve already got a good grade in class, I&#x2019;m tempted because of my grandfather. I know he&#x2019;d want me to enter: he&#x2019;s a scientist.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I haven&#x2019;t seen my grandpa Melvin in over a year. He&#x2019;s been traveling across the country, visiting places by bus, on an extended vacation. I miss everything about him. His old-man fashion style of wearing black socks. How he always orders moo goo gai pan at Chinese restaurants and steals the packets of soy sauce. Most of all, I miss talking to him. He&#x2019;s bossy and opinionated and thinks he&#x2019;s smarter than everyone else because he has two PhDs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And maybe he is.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When the last bell of the day rings, everyone rushes out of the classrooms like criminals being released.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I spot Raj waiting for me by my locker; he&#x2019;s hard to miss. He&#x2019;s tall and lean and towers over most other kids. But that&#x2019;s not the only reason he stands out. Raj has the whole goth thing going on: he&#x2019;s got piercings and is dressed entirely in black, right down to his weathered Doc Martens. Even his thick hair is black. Well, except for the long blue streak in the front. It&#x2019;s striking and makes him look like a wizard.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Hey,&#x201d; I say.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;So, you decided not to go for it, huh?&#x201d; he asks, studying my hair.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It was my idea in the first place. I wanted a change of some kind. To maybe stand out. Look a little different. My hair is pretty boring, so I thought I would dye it. My mom was all for it. She&#x2019;s always dyeing her hair crazy colors and makes it look easy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Still, I was nervous. It seemed like a big step.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Raj suggested I just get a streak in my hair. He said he&#x2019;d do it, too. A buddy thing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We endlessly debated colors. He liked the idea of red. I liked pink. We were both against green (it only looks good on leprechauns). Finally, we settled on blue.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But when I went to the hair salon this past weekend to get mine done, I panicked. What if it was a mistake? What if I looked terrible with a blue streak? Like a blue skunk?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In the end, I got my hair cut same as always (one inch) and no streak.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I couldn&#x2019;t do it,&#x201d; I admit.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s okay,&#x201d; he says.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re not mad?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Of course not.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I feel better immediately. Raj wouldn&#x2019;t lie.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Because he&#x2019;s my best friend. I know his locker combination and he knows mine.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We didn&#x2019;t start out being best friends. But over the last year, it just kind of happened. My mom says having a best friend is like learning to speak a foreign language. You stumble around for the right words, and then one day it clicks and you understand everything.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got a chess meet next week,&#x201d; Raj says. &#x201c;I was wondering if you wanted to come? It&#x2019;s here at the school.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Sure!&#x201d; I say. I&#x2019;ve never been to a chess match before.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He smiles. &#x201c;Great. Well, I gotta roll. Chess club. Catch ya later.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Bye,&#x201d; I say.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I watch as he disappears into the crowd.</p></p><h2>The Heroic Legend of Arslan 1 (Heroic Legend of Arslan, The)</h2><p><b>The fantasy epic from the creator of&nbsp;<i>Fullmetal Alchemist</i>!</b><br><br>"An epic fantasy with plenty of historical detail [and a] deft artistic hand." -Anime News Network<br><br>"Arakawa has no problem depicting the bloody reality of war: severed limbs, decapitated heads, and torture victims.

It began as a reflection on the most suitable way of communicating the heart of Christian faith to those applying for membership of the Church. In the course of the past sixteen hundred years, however, it has been frequently and creatively adapted to serve the needs of education in faith in many different contexts, including the education of clergy and religious education more generally. The two model catecheses that Augustine sketches, one quite long and the other considerably shorter, not only continue to have relevance today but also provide an important insight into his understanding of the use of scripture and tradition. And Augustine&#39;s awareness of the problems that educators face demonstrates his profound grasp of the human condition.</p><p>n/a</p><h2>Me &amp; Other Writing</h2><p>Literary Nonfiction. Fiction.

In her nonfiction as well as her fiction, Marguerite Duras's curiosity was endless, her intellect voracious.

From the stunning one-page "Me" to the sprawling 70-page "Summer 80," there is not a piece in this collection that can be easily categorized. These are essayistic works written for their times but too virtuosic to be relegated to history, works of commentary or recollection or reportage that are also, unmistakably, works of art.<br><br>Table of Contents:<br><br>CONTENTS<br><br>Introduction vii<br>Publisher's Note xvii<br><br>Flaubert Is . . . 1<br>The Sound and the Silence 13<br>My Mother Had . . . 19<br>Atlantic Black 30<br>Letter to Centre Rachi 35<br>Translation 37<br>I Thought Often . . . 39<br>Horror at Choisy-le-Roi 48<br>Nadine from Orange 57<br>Reading on the Train 67<br>True Appearances 78<br>The Men of Tomorrow 82<br>The Right, Our Death 88<br>The Horror of Such a Love 90<br>Me 93<br>Summer 80 95<br><br>Notes &amp; Context 173<br>Translators' Afterword 181<br>Biographical Notes 187<br></p><p>Marguerite Duras was one of France's most important and prolific writers. Born Marguerite Donnadieu in 1914 in what was then French Indochina, she went to Paris in 1931 to study at the Sorbonne. During WWII she was active in the Resistance, and in 1945 she joined the Communist Party. Duras wrote many novels, plays, films, and essays during her lifetime. She is perhaps best known for her internationally bestselling novel <em>The Lover</em>, which won the Prix Goncourt in 1984. She died in Paris in 1996."This is writing that demands, and provides, its own spotlight&#x2014;not only through its incandescent intelligence (as in Duras's reading of the violence enacted not by, but upon, Simone Deschamps in 'Horror at Choisy-le-Roi'), but also through its refusal of linear exposition, the way it careens from one idea to another or dashes the reader's expectation of authorly pronouncements by offering instead a lyrical image (Olivia Baes and Emma Ramadan reflect on the challenges of translating this opacity in an excellent note in the book's final pages)."&#x2014;Heather Cleary, Lit Hub "Book Marks"<br><br>"While reading Marguerite Duras, it can be hard to tell if you are pressing your hands to her chest or if she is pressing her hands to yours. Has she mined your deepest feelings or have you caught her heart's fever? Her nonfiction, written in the same blood and seawater as her fiction, produces the same sensation."&#x2014;Julia Berick, Paris Review "Staff Picks"</p><h2>The Big Free</h2><p><i>The Big Free</i> describes the medical humor and drama in the life of one of the first women surgeons in the busiest trauma surgery program in New Orleans in 1982.

Looking at Central Park from a window, you can see the snow fall steadily, shrouding all in white. Everything looks so still, so quiet...but down below, in the streets, there are the inevitable sounds of New York. Horns bleating, people shouting, the clatter of feet and traffic and excitement, only muffled, somewhat dimmed. And in the last-minute furor of Christmas Eve, there is something more, a kind of wonderful tension waiting to explode in laughter and gifts...people hurrying home, with packages stacked high in their arms, carolers singing, the innumerable Santa Clauses, tipsy and red-faced, celebrating their last night in the deadly cold, women holding tight to children's hands, admonishing them to be careful not to fall, and then smiling, laughing. Everyone in a rush, in high spirits, in unison for this one night of the year...Merry Christmas!...doormen waving, happy with their Christmas tips. In a day, a week, the excitement will be forgotten, the gifts unwrapped, the liquor drunk, the money spent, but on Christmas Eve nothing is yet over, it has only just begun. For the children it is a culmination of months of waiting, for the adults the end of frenzied weeks, of parties shopping, people, gifts...bright hopes as fresh as falling snow, and nostalgic smiles, remembering distant childhoods and long-forgotten loves. A time of memories, and hope, and love.<br> As the snow fell steadily the traffic began to thin at last. It was bitter cold, and only a few hardy souls were walking in the snow as it crunched beneath their feet. What had turned to slush earlier that day had now turned to ice, which slid wickedly beneath the six inches of fresh snow. It was treacherous walking, and by eleven o'clock traffic had all but ground to a halt. For New York it was unusually silent. Only an occasional horn sounded in the distance, a random voice calling out for a cab.<br><br> The sound of a dozen people leaving the party at 12 East Sixty-ninth Street rang out like bells in the night. They were laughing, singing, they had had a wonderful time. The champagne had been abundant, and there had been hot buttered rum and mulled wine, a huge Christmas tree and bowls of popcorn. Everyone had been given small gifts as they left, bottles of perfume, boxes of chocolates, a pretty scarf, a book. The host was a former book reviewer of <i>The New York Times, </i>his wife a celebrated author, their friends an interesting crew, from budding writers to concert pianists of repute, great beauties and great minds, all crushed into the huge living room in their town house, with a butler and two maids passing hors d'oeuvres and serving drinks. It had been planned as their annual Christmas cocktail party, and as always it would go on until three or four. The group that left just before midnight was small, and among them was a tiny blond woman wearing a large mink hat and a long dark mink coat. Her whole body was enveloped in the rich chocolate fur, her face barely peeking above her collar in the wind as she waved for a last time at her friends and began to walk home. She didn't want to share a taxi with them. She had seen enough people for one evening, she wanted to be alone. For her, Christmas Eve was always a difficult evening. For years she had stayed at home. But not tonight. Not this year. This time she had wanted to see friends, at least for a while. Everyone had been surprised and pleased to see her there.<br><br> "Nice to see you, Daphne. You're back. Working on a book?"<br><br> "Just starting one." The big blue eyes were gentle and the delicate sweetness of her face belied her age.<br><br> "What does that mean? You'll finish it next week?" She was notoriously prolific, but had been working on a movie for the past year.<br><br> She smiled again, this time with more mirth. She was used to their teasing. A touch of envy...curiosity...respect. She was a woman who inspired all three. Daphne Fields was intensely private, hardworking, ambitious, determined, visible in literary circles, and yet even when she was present, she wasn't always really there. She always seemed as though she was just one step back, just out of reach, and yet when she looked at you, you could feel her touch your very soul. She seemed to see everything, and yet at the same time, she didn't seem to wish to be seen. She was different than she had been ten years before. At twenty-three she had been gregarious, funny, outrageous...protected, safe, happy. She was quieter now, the laughter of the past only showed now in glimpses in her eyes, its echo buried somewhere in her soul.<br><br> "Daphne?" She turned around quickly at the corner of Madison Avenue as she heard footsteps behind her, muffled by the snow.<br><br> "Yes, Jack?" It was Jack Hawkins, the editorial director of her current publishing house, Harbor and Jones, his face red from the cold, his eyes a brilliant blue and watering in the wind.<br><br> "Don't you want a ride?"<br><br> She shook her head and smiled, and it struck him again how tiny she was, buried in the huge mink coat, her black suede gloved hands holding the collar close. "No, but thanks. I really want to walk. I live just down the street."<br><br> "It's late." As always, when he saw her, he found himself wanting to take her in his arms. Not that he ever did. But he would have liked to. So would a lot of other men. At thirty-three she still looked twenty-five, and sometimes twelve...vulnerable, fresh, delicate...but there was something more. There was a loneliness in the woman's eyes, which tore at your very soul, no matter how spectacular her smile, how warm her eyes. She was a woman alone. And she shouldn't have been. If life were fair, she wouldn't have been. But she was. "It's midnight, Daff..." He hesitated before rejoining the others walking slowly west.<br><br> "It's Christmas Eve, Jack. And it's cold as hell." She grinned, her sense of humor leaping to her eyes. "I don't think I'll get raped tonight."<br><br> He smiled. "No, but you could slip and fall on the ice."<br><br> "Aha! And break my arm and not be able to write for months, is that it? Don't worry. I don't have another deadline till April."<br><br> "For chrissake, come on. You can come home with us for a drink."<br><br> She stood on tiptoe and kissed his cheek as she patted his shoulder with one hand. "Go on. I'm fine. But thanks." She waved him off then, and turned and walked quickly along the street, burying her chin in her coat, looking neither right nor left, not glancing at the shop windows, or the faces of the few people who walked past her. The wind felt wonderful on her face, and as she made her way home she felt better than she had all night. It had been an exhausting evening, it always was at parties like that, no matter how pleasant they were, how many people she knew, they were always the same. But she had wanted to be there tonight. She didn't want to be alone in her apartment, she didn't want to hold on to the memories this year...didn't want to...couldn't stand it anymore.... Even now, as her face tingled in the snow, the same memories came back to her, and she walked faster as though to outrun them, as though she ever could.<br><br> Almost instinctively she ran to the corner, glanced to see if there was any traffic, saw none, and assumed that the light was green...as though if she ran fast enough, if she crossed the street, she could leave the memories behind. But she always took them everywhere with her...especially on Christmas Eve.<br><br> Running faster across Madison Avenue, she almost lost her footing as she slipped and then regained her balance as her arms flailed wide. The corner met, she turned rapidly left, to cross the street, and this time she didn't look up in time to see the car, a long red station wagon filled with people, hurrying through the last of their green light, her red. There was a shriek from the woman sitting beside the driver, a thump, another scream from within the car, and a strange sliding noise as the car ground across the ice and stopped at last. For an interminable instant, everything was silence. And then all the car doors opened at once, and half a dozen people rushed outside. There were no voices, no words, no more screams as the driver hurried toward her and then stopped, staring down at the woman lying like a small broken rag doll, cast face-down into the snow.<br><br> "Oh, my God...oh, my God..." He stood there helplessly for a moment, and then turned frantically toward the woman standing beside him, a look of terror mixed with fury, as though someone had to be blamed for this, anyone but him. "For chrissake, call the cops." He knelt beside her then, afraid to touch her, to move her, yet even more afraid that she was dead.<br><br> "Is she...alive? Another man knelt in the snow beside the driver, bourbon still heavy on his breath.<br><br> "I don't know." There were no plumes of icy vapor from her breathing, no movement, no sound, no life. And then suddenly the man who touched her began to cry softly. "I killed her, Harry.... I killed her..." He reached out toward his friend and the two men hugged in silent agony as they knelt there, as two cabs and an empty bus stopped and the drivers ran out.<br><br> "What happened?" Suddenly all was action, talking, explanations...she ran out in front of the car...never looked up...didn't see her...icy...couldn't stop...<br><br> "Where the hell are the police when you need them?" The driver cursed as the snow fell around him...thinking, for no reason he could understand, of the carol they had sung only an hour earlier..."Silent night, holy night"...and now this woman lay in the snow in front of him, dead or dying, and there were no damn cops.<br><br> "Lady?...Lady, can you hear me?" The bus driver was kneeling beside her, his face next to hers, trying to feel her breath on his face. "She's alive." He looked up at the others. "You got a blanket?" No one moved. And then, almost angrily, "Give me your coat." For a moment the driver of the station wagon looked shocked. "For chrissake, man, the woman may be dying. Take your coat off." He hurriedly complied then, as did two others, and they buried Daphne beneath a multitude of coats. "Don't try to move her." The old black bus driver looked as though he knew what he was doing as he tucked the heavy coats around her and gently cradled her face, to keep it from freezing in the snow. A moment later the flashing red light appeared. It was a city ambulance and they'd had a busy night so far. They always did on Christmas Eve. A police car was just behind them, its eerie whooping siren screeching hideously as it arrived.<br><br> The ambulance attendants hurried at once to Daphne, the police moved more slowly as they took in the scene, and the driver of the station wagon hurried toward them, calmer now, but trembling horribly from the cold, as his coat lay on the street. The bus driver watched as the ambulance attendants gently rolled Daphne onto the gurney. There was no sound from her, no consciousness of pain. He saw now that her face was skinned and cut in several places, but there had been no bleeding as she lay face-down in the icy snow.<br><br> The police took a report from the driver, and explained that he would have to take a sobriety test before he could be released. All the others clamored that he was sober, that he had drunk less than anyone that evening, and that Daphne had run out in front of the car without even looking, and against the light.<br><br> "Sorry, it's routine." The policeman showed no particular sympathy for the driver, nor did he show any emotion as he glanced at Daphne's face. Another woman, another victim, another case. He saw worse than that almost every evening. Muggings, beatings, murders, rapes. "She alive?"<br><br> "Yeah." The ambulance driver nodded tersely. "Just." They had just slid an oxygen mask into place, and pulled open the mink coat to check her heartbeat. "But we're going to lose her if we don't hurry."<br><br> "Where's she going?" The policeman was scribbling on his report, "white female of undetermined age...probably mid-thirties."<br><br> The ambulance driver called over his shoulder as they closed the door on Daphne. "We're going to take her to Lenox Hill, it's the closest. I don't think she'd make it farther than that."<br><br> "Is she a Jane Doe?" That would be another headache. They'd already sent off two unidentified murder victims to the morgue that night.<br><br> "No. She had a purse."<br><br> "Okay, we'll follow you. I can copy it down there." There was a terse nod as the driver disappeared to get his charge to Lenox Hill, and the police officer turned back to the shivering driver as he struggled back into his coat. "Are you going to arrest me?" He looked terrified now. His Christmas had turned instantly into a nightmare as he remembered the vision of Daphne lying face-down in the street.<br><br> "Not unless you're drunk. We can give you the sobriety test at the hospital. Have one of your friends drive and follow us there." The man nodded and slipped back into his car, nodding at one of his friends, who slipped rapidly behind the wheel. There was no talking now, no gaiety, no laughter. There was only silence as they followed the double wail of sirens toward Lenox Hill.<br> Excerpted from <i>Once In A Lifetime</i> by Danielle Steel. Copyright � 1982 by Danielle Steel.

Ten award-winning writers: Mary Pope Osborne, Laurence Yep, James Howe, Katherine Paterson, Walter Dean Myers, Susan Cooper, Nicholasa Mohr, Reeve Lindbergh, Avi, and Francesca Lia Block tell young readers stories drawn from their own childhood memories. The authors have also contributed notes about why they chose particular memories to write about and what in their lives led them to be writers. In this way, the extraordinary stories in&nbsp;<i>When I Was Your Age</i>&nbsp;bear witness to the origins of a writer&#x2019;s art &#x2014; and honor the courage, tenderness, and fragility of children.</p><p>Amy Ehrlich, the editor of WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE, notes that &#34;writing begins with observation. The authors in this collection, like all children, felt things deeply. But they were also able to observe their feelings and therefore remember them well. Those memories are a writer&#39;s most durable tool.&#34; Amy Ehrlich is the author of more than 25 books for young readers.Grade 5 Up?Ehrlich asked 10 children's book authors to contribute a story based on their childhoods. The result is a fascinating glimpse into a variety of times, places, plots, and people. Some of the selections are funny, some sad, some a mixture, but they all express feelings and describe situations that young people can identify with?whether it is Laurence Yep's discovery that his father really loved him for himself or Walter Dean Myers's friends trying to get even with the adults who spoiled their fun, or Mary Pope Osborne's revelation of how she held on to a deflated rubber ball, a gift from her soldier father, until he returned safely from the war in Korea. Each story is followed by a note from the author that explains to what degree the incidents are true and why the piece was submitted. The writing is of such high caliber that all the stories sound true and readers are sure to believe that the incidences described really happened. It is a disappointment then, to learn that a particular story, or part of it, is fiction. A picture of the author as a child precedes each entry. The selections are so varied and so well written that children will find at least one they would enjoy reading. Librarians will have to encourage their students not to judge this book by its dull cover, but to open it so they can be entertained by 10 master storytellers.?Nancy P.

Widely reviled as a religious fanatic who sought to violently oppress Hindus, he is even blamed by some for setting into motion conflicts that would result in the creation of a separate Muslim state in South Asia. In her lively overview of his life and influence, Audrey Truschke offers a clear-eyed perspective on the public debate over Aurangzeb and makes the case for why his often-maligned legacy deserves to be reassessed.</p> <p>Aurangzeb was arguably the most powerful and wealthiest ruler of his day. His nearly 50-year reign (1658&#x2013;1707) had a profound influence on the political landscape of early modern India, and his legacy&#x2015;real and imagined&#x2015;continues to loom large in India and Pakistan today. Truschke evaluates Aurangzeb not by modern standards but according to the traditions and values of his own time, painting a picture of Aurangzeb as a complex figure whose relationship to Islam was dynamic, strategic, and sometimes contradictory. This book invites students of South Asian history and religion into the world of the Mughal Empire, framing the contemporary debate on Aurangzeb's impact and legacy in accessible and engaging terms.</p></p><p><b>Audrey Truschke</b> is Assistant Professor of History at Rutgers University. She is the author of <i>Culture of Encounters: Sanskrit at the Mughal Court</i> (2016)."Truschke is to be applauded on a number of counts: her courage for writing a biography of Aurangzeb (), her willingness to write a book that is easily accessible to nonspecialists, her skill in integrating large amounts of information within a coherent narrative, her thoughtfulness when balancing conflicting evidence, and her ability to give Aurangzeb his due without coming across as an apologist."&#x2013;&#x2013;Munis D. Faruqui, <i>Journal of the American Academy of Religion</i><br><br>Following British historians of the colonial era, Indian nationalists used the last and most controversial of the great Mughals in ways that simultaneously distorted Mughal history and served as a goad to Hindu cultural renewal. Audrey Truschke's project of looking at Emperor Aurangzeb afresh is thus a welcome and timely one and will interest readers in academia and beyond." (Barbara D. Metcalf <i>University of California, Davis</i>)<br><br>"Truschke's laudable objective is to criticize Hindu nationalism, which makes the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb (r. 1658-1707) into a metonym for the Muslim community, and vilifies the emperor in order to vilify the community almost in its entirety....Truschke demonstrates with superb precision that the political-theological fault lines in Aurangzeb's reign did not run along simple Muslim versus Hindu / Sikh binaries." (Milinda Banerjee <i><i>Sehepunkte</i></i>)<br><br>"Basing her judgments on a careful reading of contemporary Persian chronicles and European traveler accounts, Audrey Truschke presents a fresh, balanced, and much-needed survey of one of the most controversial figures in Indian history. Crucially, the author insists on evaluating the man in terms of the norms and traditions of his own day, and not those of later, more polarized times." (Richard M. Eaton <i>University of Arizona</i>)</p><h2>The Tragedy of Coriolanus: The Oxford Shakespeare The Tragedy of Coriolanus</h2><p>Perhaps the most brilliant political play ever written, Coriolanus is a gripping psychological study of the relationship between personality and politics, and its Roman hero one of the most memorable Shakespeare ever created.

The book features an Introduction by Gloria Steinem. </p><p>The book is a conversation with 19 prominent women artists, lawyers, ranchers, doctors, educators and activists. They share their unique--and surprisingly candid--perspectives on ceremony, the importance of context, Native American governance, womanhood, love and acceptance, and the value of traditional knowledge and institutions. </p><p>Says Steinem in her Introduction, "Wilma Mankiller has brought together wise voices in a conversation about the things for which we long the most," including Community, Balance, Peaceful Ways of Resolving Differences and Being of Good Mind. </p><p>Mankiller sees Every Day is a Good Day as an affirmation of the important role women with traditional knowledge have played in the political and cultural survival of Native people. "Our unique tribal worldview has enabled our culture and governments to endure war, relocation, loss of land and lives," she says. "And it is that worldview that has allowed me to remain positive even as I have dealt with two kidney transplants and two bouts of cancer." </p><p>The conversations were held in separate places, from Onondaga Territory in New York to Hawaii, but are presented as a larger discussion to evoke a sense of a gathering. "They find many moments of grace, beauty, and joy in their busy lives," says Mankiller. "And despite everything, they tend to view economic poverty as a barrier and a challenge, not a state of being." </p><p>"I hope that EVERY DAY IS A GOOD DAY will help people from many different communities learn about the special world in which these women live and see how they conduct their lives with dignity, faith, hope, and optimism," says Mankiller.</p><b>Wilma Mankiller </b>was an author, activist, and former principal chief of the Cherokee Nation.

Iren�us by the Vatican Ms. 331 and one of the Mss. used by the editor of the Leipzig Catena, is by his other Ms. attributed to Diodorus, and probably also (since Muenter was the first to publish it) the 3 Paris Catenae consulted by Massuet attribute this fragment to Diodorus or some other writer.</p><p>P.

As a novelist, he was a finalist for the Pulitzer. And as a theologian and preacher, he pioneered the art of making theology accessible for a popular audience. Yet for all Buechner's enormous influence, many readers today are unfamiliar with his work, or have read him only in one genre. In this book, Buechner expert Jeffrey Munroe presents a collection of the true "essentials" from across Buechner's diverse catalog, as well as an overview of Buechner's life and a discussion of the state of his literary legacy today. Here is Buechner in all his complex glory, ready to delight and inspire again.</p><p>Jeffrey Munroe is executive vice president at Western Theological Seminary, where he also teaches writing. He was a charter member of the advisory board of the Buechner Institute of Faith and Culture, and is an ordained minister in the Reformed Church in America."Bringing his lifetime of grappling faithfully with all things Buechner, the inestimable Jeff Munroe proves a winsome and trustworthy guide to the essential works of Frederick Buechner. If you've always wanted to read Buechner but didn't know where to start, <em>Reading Buechner</em> is the introduction you've been looking for. And if you're a longtime reader, Jeff does a lovely job of finding new ways to appreciate and celebrate the richness of Buechner's works." (Jennifer L. Holberg, Calvin University professor of English and codirector, Calvin Center for Faith &amp; Writing)<br><br>"I am one who wonders why so many Christians spend so much time talking about and writing about Christianity. Instead of the Word becoming flesh, it becomes more and more words. Jeffrey Munroe, in his masterfully clear and insightful <em>Reading Buechner</em>, opens up about why Frederick Buechner devoted his career to, yes, more words. Why? Because incarnation is at the heart of Buechner's faith. His great hope is that his words, like all effective literature, will become flesh, in his work Christian flesh. Munroe, in a voice that feels as if he is sitting with you on the porch, reveals that Buechner writes out from the 'flesh' of his inner life hoping to connect with the inner life of anyone struggling within God's love-endangered world. Even if you've already read Buechner's work, read Jeffrey Munroe's informative and invigorating <em>Reading Buechner</em>, then get on it and read Buechner again, perhaps for the first time." (Jack Ridl, author of Broken Symmetry, Losing Season, Practicing to Walk Like a Heron, and St. Peter and the Goldfinch)<br><br>"Jeff has listened to the depth and more significantly to the breadth of Buechner's work in a way no one else ever has. His work enables each of us now to listen further to Buechner's remarkable literary voice for ourselves. Moreover this book comes at a crucial time, providing the next generation with a badly needed introduction to one of the most important theological writers of our time." (Michael Card, Bible teacher, songwriter)<br><br>"With a personal appreciation for Frederick Buechner's words and a thoroughly researched knowledge of the experiences that formed them, Jeffrey Munroe's <em>Reading Buechner</em> is a deft combination of biography and reading companion. I had only known Buechner from <em>Telling the Truth</em>; this book has inspired me to seek out so much more." (Josh Larsen, author of Movies Are Prayers and editor/podcast host for ThinkChristian)<br><br>"<em>Reading Buechner</em> gives us exactly what the title promises. These are a fan's notes, based on many years of reading and reflection, aimed at fellow Buechnerites but also readily accessible to newcomers. Unpretentious but deeply versed in his subject, Jeffrey Munroe is a winsome guide." (John Wilson, contributing editor, Englewood Review of Books)<br><br>"A much-needed spiritual biography of the minister-writer who has found himself walking the borders (to quote visual artist Makoto Fujimura) of faith and literature, never truly at home in either. Jeffrey Munroe invites us to listen not only to Frederick Buechner's books but also to his life. And in turn, we listen to our own." (Sarah Arthur, author of A Light So Lovely)<br><br>"These lively reflections on Buechner's writing and life, laced with well-told anecdotes and theological insights, offer readers a valuable guide and a capacious story of grace. Jeff Munroe brings his own considerable skill in storytelling, his deeply informed admiration for a monumental life and work, and his deep faith to bear on the happy task of helping the rest of us read Buechner&#x2015;with fresh appreciation for the way he continues to speak into a new historical moment with truths that emerge 'from below time.'" (Marilyn McEntyre, author of Caring for Words in a Culture of Lies and Word by Word)</p><h2>Knowledge Rich Ranching</h2><p><p><em>Knowledge Rich Ranching</em> is not a how-to book on raising cattle. It is a book on how the cattle business works. It has not been sanitized nor edited by Ms. Rosy Scenario. It is about the way things really are. It is about fear and greed, and how the commodity business eats alive the naive and unaware. In today&#x2019;s market, it is knowledge that separates the rich from the rest.</p> <p><em>Knowledge Rich Ranching</em> is packed with guidelines for how to read and profit from the upside-down swings of the cattle cycle. It describes various bookkeeping methods and tax tips; covers cost cutting to eliminate profit leaks; reveals the secrets of high profit grass farms and ranches; details strategies for using Management-intensive Grazing in humid and arid climates as well as during adverse weather conditions. And it explains family and business structure with suggestions for estate planning to keep today&#x2019;s ranch or grass farm viable and profitable for future generations.</p> <p>While focused on raising cattle, the principles in <em>Knowledge Rich Ranching</em> apply equally to producers of other livestock enterprises&#x2015;sheep, in particular, which run backwards to the cattle cycle and can add a complementary enterprise to an existing cattle operation. Anyone who has profit as his or her goal will benefit from this book. It is the first to cover the business management principles of grassland farming and ranching.</p></p><p><p>Allan Nation served as the editor of <em>The Stockman Grass Farmer</em> magazine from 1977 until his death in November, 2016.</p> <p>Begun in 1947, it was Mississippi&#x2019;s oldest farm publication. Based in Ridgeland, Mississippi, <em>The Stockman Grass Farmer</em> is an international publication that covers management-intensive grassland enterprises for producers of pasture-raised livestock. This includes stocker cattle, grass finished beef and lamb, and pasture-based dairying. It is the only monthly publication in North America devoted solely to management-intensive grassland farming in all its aspects.</p> <p>The son of a commercial cattle rancher, Nation grew up in Greenville, Mississippi. He traveled to some 30 countries around the world studying and photographing grassland farming systems. In 1987, he authored a section on Management-intensive Grazing in the <em>USDA Yearbook of Agriculture</em> and served as a consultant and resource for Audubon Society Television Specials, National Geographic, WTBS, PBS, and National Public Radio. He received the 1993 Agricultural Conservation Award from the American Farmland Trust for spearheading the drive behind the grass farming revolution in the United States.</p> <p>Nation was a featured speaker at ranching and grasslands conference and authored 11 books on pasture-based livestock and artisan meats and milk products<em>.</em></p><p><em>"Knowledge Rich Ranching</em> will expose you to what you need to understand when you sit down to the kitchen table on winter nights to determine how not only to make it through another year, but to develop a long-term economically sustainable farm or ranch.</p> <p>From goal setting to the harsh realities of the cattle cycle, from financial planning and business structure to the successful mindset, Nation&#x2019;s book brings knowledge into once convenient, concise and readable package."<strong>&#x2013;David W. Morrison, <em>Rural Papers</em></strong></p><br><br><p>"Allan Nation makes an interesting declaration early in his book, <em>Knowledge Rich Ranching</em>.&nbsp; &#x201c;A basic principle of ranching,&#x201d; Nation says, &#x201c;is that land ownership and cattle are two separate businesses. Going out and purchasing a ranch and then buying some cows in hopes that they will pay off the note is a sure ticket to financial disaster.&#x201d; Nothing equivocal about that. The rest of his book carries the same tone.</p> <p>His points have been echoed by others in economic digressions but the points too often are missed or ignored. Throughout the book Nation ends each chapter section with what he labels &#x201c;profit points.&#x201d; Even people who don&#x2019;t farm or ranch will find interesting points to think about. Most of the book is about the skills needed to run a cattle ranch, and the philosophical observations are just asides or bonuses."<strong>&#x2013;Virgil Rupp, <em>Agri-Times NW</em></strong></p></p><h2>Trauma Competency: A Clinician&#39;s Guide</h2><p>This is a book for clinicians.

Dr. Huang discusses the core aspects of the ten most important families of formulas in the classical formula tradition in a way that is both profound and accessible. By introducing the concept of constitutions and the attendant vulnerabilities of those constitutions to certain types of disorders, he hands the reader a very useful key to understanding how and when to use these formulas in the clinic. The ten families of formulas are grouped around the following herbs: <br>Cinnamon - Cinnamomi Ramulus <br>Ephedra - Ephedrae Herba <br>Bupleurum - Bupleuri Radix <br>Gypsum - Gypsum fibrosum <br>Rhubarb - Rhei Radix et Rhizoma <br>Coptis - Coptidis Rhizoma <br>Aconite accessory root - Aconiti Radix lateralis preparata <br>Dried ginger - Zingiberis Rhizoma <br>Astragalus - Astragali Radix <br>Pinellia - Pinelliae Rhizoma preparatum <p>For each family of formulas, Dr. Huang describes the associated presentation and constitutional aspects common to all members of the family, then turns to the individual formulas that are especially useful for treating particular aspects of that presentation.

I&#x2019;ve changed the names of all schoolmates and friends as well as many identifying details. Some of the people portrayed are composites.

So as I started writing this memoir, I wondered what was more important: what actually happened or what I remembered happening.<br> <br>I think the answer depends on who&#x2019;s doing the telling. How I remember events is more important to this memoir than how someone else remembers them, and someone else&#x2019;s recollection isn&#x2019;t necessarily the objective truth either. For example, I don&#x2019;t remember my mom crying when she came to the emergency room after my suicide attempt. Her strength and stoicism set an example for me later in my life. If I found out that she had actually cried in the ER, it wouldn&#x2019;t change the effect my original belief ultimately had on me.<br> <br>Therefore, while I&#x2019;ve done my best to verify dates and other objective truths, the majority of this memoir is how I remember events. Anything I&#x2019;ve gotten wrong is on me.<br> <br>Finally, this memoir contains e-mails, journal entries, and some of my early writing. Even though it&#x2019;s incredibly embarrassing, I&#x2019;ve left all my awful grammar and spelling errors intact except where doing so rendered the passage too confusing to read. Please don&#x2019;t judge me.</p><h2>100 Activities Based on the Catechism of the Catholic Church</h2><p><b>New and updated second edition!</b><p>Sometimes when teaching children an aspect of our Catholic Faith, it is helpful to have a special activity to reinforce the lesson.

First looking at the development of printed books and the simultaneous emergence of the modern figure of the artist, <i>The Art of Reading</i> appraises works by the many great masters who took inspiration from the printed word. Bringing together more than one hundred paintings that include books as part of their subject matter, this lively and companionable survey examines how the book became the single most ubiquitous feature of our cultural lives and, in large measure, of everyday existence.<br> &nbsp;<br> Authors Jamie Camplin and Maria Ranauro weave together an engaging cultural history that probes the ways in which books and paintings represent a key to understanding ourselves and the past. Paintings contain a world of information about religion, class, gender, and power, but they also reveal details of everyday life often lost in history texts&#x2014;and all the more so when books are depicted. Such artworks show us not only how books have been used and valued over time but also how the significance and practice of reading have evolved in Western society.<br> &nbsp;<br> Featuring work by artists from across Europe and the United States and all painting genres, <i>The Art of Reading</i> explores the two-thousand-year story of the great painters and the preeminent information-providing, knowledge-endowing, solace-giving, belief-supporting, leisure-enriching, pleasure-delivering medium of all time: the book.<br> &nbsp;</p><p>Jamie Camplin is a Cambridge-educated historian who retired in 2013 from a distinguished career as Thames &amp; Hudson&#x2019;s editorial and then managing director.

You can usually find her at home&#x2014;she lives at 204 Rosewood Lane&#x2014;or at the public library, where she works. Like me, she grew up in this town and she's raised two daughters here. But did you hear that about six months ago, her husband disappeared? Just...disappeared. <em>Where's Dan?</em> Why did he go? Who's he with? Will Grace ever find out?<br><br>I hope that all of us, her family and friends, are bringing her comfort during this difficult time. Comfort and a sense of shelter. I'm continually reminded that life can and does go on. For instance, everyone's been discussing weddings and babies lately. Justine, my daughter, rather impulsively got married a little while ago. Grace's daughter Kelly recently had a baby. Unfortunately, she refuses to accept that Dan might not return to see his first grandchild. Grace's older daughter, Maryellen, is more realistic. Grace thinks she's seeing a new man but for some reason won't say who it is.<br><br>Then there's Jack Griffin, our local newspaper editor, the man I've been seeing. And...well, I have lots to tell you. Come on over and we'll talk!<br><br>Olivia<br><br></p><p>Debbie Macomber is a #1 New York Times bestselling author and a leading voice in women&#x2019;s fiction worldwide.

For more information, visit her website, www.debbiemacomber.com.<br><br>Grace Sherman stared down at the legal form that would start the divorce proceedings. She sat in the attorney's office with Maryellen, her oldest daughter, who'd come with her to offer support. Grace reminded herself that this should be straightforward, that her decision was made. She was ready to end her marriage, ready to piece together her shattered life. To begin again... But her hand shook as she picked up the pen.<br><br>The inescapable fact was that she didn't want this&#x2014;but Dan hadn't left her with any other option.<br><br>Five months ago, in April, her husband of almost thirty-six years had disappeared. Vanished without a trace. One day everything was perfectly normal, and the next he was gone. Apparently by choice and without a word of explanation. Even now, Grace had difficulty believing that the man she'd lived with, the man she'd loved and with whom she'd had two daughters, could do anything as cruel as this.<br><br>If Dan had fallen out of love with her, she could accept that. She would've found enough pride, enough generosity, to release him without bitterness. If he was that miserable in their marriage, she would've gladly set him free to find happiness with someone else. What she couldn't forgive was the misery he'd heaped on their family's shoulders, what he'd done to their daughters. Especially Kelly.<br><br>Dan had disappeared shortly after Kelly and Paul had announced that after years of trying, they were finally, excitedly, pregnant. Dan had been thrilled, and Grace, too. This baby was going to be their first grandchild. They'd waited so long.<br><br>Kelly had always been close to her father and his disappearance at this critical time in her life had devastated her. She'd pleaded with Grace to postpone the divorce proceedings, convinced that her father would return before Tyler was born. When Dan did return, he'd have a logical reason and would explain everything to their satisfaction.<br><br>He hadn't come back, though, and there'd been no further information. Nothing but doubts, questions and a churning, deepening anger that intensified in the endless weeks that followed.<br><br>When Grace couldn't stand not knowing any longer, she'd hired Roy McAfee, a private detective and former policeman she trusted. Roy had done an extensive search, certain that Dan had left a paper trail, and he'd been right. What Roy had uncovered was a complete shock to Grace. A year earlier, Dan had purchased a travel trailer, paying cash for it. Grace had no idea where he'd gotten that kind of money, nor did she know anything about the trailer. He'd never mentioned it, nor had she seen it. To this day she had no idea where he'd kept it all those months. Or where it was now.<br><br>Given the mounting evidence, she had her suspicions.<br><br>Grace believed that Dan had used the travel trailer to sneak away with another woman. There'd been one sighting of him and it had come late in May. It almost felt as if her husband had orchestrated this brief reappearance, as if he was taunting her, challenging her to find him. That day had been a low point for Grace.<br><br>A coworker of Dan's had spotted him at the marina and Maryellen had hurried to the library to fetch her. But by the time Grace reached the marina, Dan was gone. A woman had pulled up to the curb and Dan had climbed into the vehicle and driven away, never to be seen or heard from again.<br><br>In retrospect, she'd come to believe that Dan was providing her with the answers she so desperately needed. She could think of no other reason he would mysteriously arrive at the busiest place in town, where he was most likely to be seen&#x2014;and recognized. The library where she worked was less than two blocks away. Clearly, her husband lacked the courage to tell her there was someone else. Instead he'd chosen another, crueler way to inform her; he'd humiliated her in front of the entire community. Grace knew without being told that everyone in Cedar Cove pitied her.<br><br>That sighting had settled the matter in Grace's mind. Whatever love she still felt for Dan died that afternoon. Until then, she hadn't wanted to believe there was someone else. Even when the VISA bill showed up with a hefty charge from a local jeweler, Grace had refused to accept that her husband was involved with another woman. Dan just wasn't the kind of man who would be unfaithful to her. She'd trusted him. Not anymore.<br><br>"Are you okay, Mom?" Maryellen asked, touching her arm.<br><br>Grace's hand tightened around the pen. "Fine," she snapped, instantly regretting her tone. She hadn't meant to sound so sharp.<br><br>Her daughter looked away. Grace focused on the divorce papers, hesitated a moment longer and then with haste signed her name.<br><br>"I'll see that this is filed immediately," Mark Spellman said.<br><br>Grace relaxed, leaning back in her chair. This was all there was to it? You could end a thirty-five-year marriage simply by signing your name? "That's it?"<br><br>"Yes. Since you haven't heard from Daniel in five months, I don't foresee any legal complications. The divorce should be final in a few weeks."<br><br>Almost four decades tossed out the window like so much garbage. The good years, the bad years, the lean ones, the years they'd scrimped and saved. Like all couples, they'd had their share of problems, but despite everything they'd held their marriage together. Until now, until this&#x2014;<br><br>"Mom?" Maryellen whispered.<br><br>Grace nodded abruptly, surprised at the emotion that choked her. She'd shed all the tears she intended to. In the months since Dan's disappearance, Grace had deeply grieved the loss of her marriage and the man she thought she knew. The truth of it was, she no longer had a choice; divorce had become inevitable. It was essential that she protect her financial interests. According to the attorney, she couldn't afford the luxury of doing nothing.<br><br>Her legal situation was one thing, and she'd dealt with that, but the emotional impact had left her badly shaken. Despite her resolve, the grief hadn't diminished. And the humiliation of what Dan had done was with her constantly. Everyone in town was aware of her circumstances and the fact that her husband had walked out on her.<br><br>Slowly, Grace set the pen aside.<br><br>"I'll wait to hear from you, then," she said to her attorney, rising out of the chair. Maryellen stood with her.<br><br>The attorney, a young man closer to Maryellen's age than her own, escorted them to the office door. He began to say something, then merely looked down and murmured a brief goodbye.<br><br>Outside his small home office, the sky had turned a depressing leaden gray. Grace felt a burden of sadness settle over her; she'd known this appointment wasn't going to be easy, but she hadn't expected it to exact such a toll on her self-confidence.<br><br>Maryellen glanced at her watch. "I need to get back to the gallery."<br><br>"I know," Grace said. Her daughter had offered to go to this appointment with her for moral support. Although she was grateful, Grace had thought it unnecessary. But Maryellen was right.<br><br>Her daughter was divorced, too. Maryellen had married young and unwisely, and the marriage had ended in less than a year. The experience had so biased her against men, she'd steered away from relationships ever since. Grace had tried to assure her that she'd meet a wonderful man someday, a man waiting for someone exactly like her. Maryellen had considered that naive and refused to listen and now Grace understood why. Divorce <em>hurt,</em> and it was the kind of vicious pain that reached deep inside a person. Grace felt off balance and guilty, as though she had somehow failed. As though it was all her fault. Maryellen knew what it was like because she'd experienced these emotions herself when she was much younger and without the wisdom or perspective maturity brings.<br><br>"Will you be all right?" Maryellen asked, obviously reluctant to leave.<br><br>"Of course," Grace said, forcing a smile. She ought to be feeling a measure of relief, after all. She'd finally taken action. She'd given Dan every opportunity, even issued a series of mental ultimatums and deadlines. He would come back when Kelly's baby was born. By the Fourth of July. By their wedding anniversary. First one, then another, until she faced the truth. He <em>wasn't</em> coming back. If she hadn't heard anything from him by now, she shouldn't expect that she ever would. Dan had no intention of being found.<br><br>"Are you going back to work?" Maryellen asked.<br><br>"No," she said, refusing to allow herself to succumb to self-pity. "I'm going to lunch."<br><br>"Lunch? It's after four. You didn't eat earlier?"<br><br>"No." Grace didn't add that her appetite had been nonexistent for days as the appointment with the attorney grew closer. Then, because she knew her daughter was worried, she added emphatically, "I <em>am</em> going to be all right, Maryellen."<br><br>Maryellen gazed down the steep hill toward the waterfront, where boats gently bobbed in the protected waters of the cove. Vehicles cruised down Harbor Street, so close together they looked like one continuous line. The Bremerton shipyard workers were out, and traffic filled the roads as husbands and fathers hurried home to their families. The same way Dan once had.<br><br>"I'm so furious with Dad I don't know what I'd do if I ever saw him again," Maryellen said between gritted teeth.<br><br>Grace knew, though. She was convinced that Maryellen would be grateful, that she wouldn't care what he'd done as long as he came home. And Kelly, their youngest, would shout with joy and tell them all how wrong they'd been. She'd run to her father with open arms, eagerly awaiting the excuse that would explain everything.<br><br>"I'm fine," Grace insisted. "Really." Still Maryellen hesitated. "I hate to leave you"<br><br>"I'll get over this." Although that was hardly the way she felt. But if Grace had learned anything in life, it was the importance of balance. For each loss, there were compensations, and she reminded herself to keep the good things firmly in sight. "I have so much to be grateful for. You and Kelly, and now a grandson. I'm so sorry it had to end this way with your father and me, but I'm going to come back stronger than ever." Even as she said the words, Grace knew they were true. The sense of loss was profound, but balance would return to her life and so would joy.<br><br>It was Justine Gunderson's lunch break, and all she wanted to do was run home and check the mail. She hadn't heard from Seth in nearly a week. All right, five days, but each one of those days felt like a year. Her husband of little more than a month was in Alaska, fishing the crab-rich waters of the Bering Sea. Seth had warned her when she drove him to the airport that he'd be working sixteen-hour days. He'd assured her that he was crazy in love with her and would be back before she had time to miss him.<br><br>Seth had been wrong. Justine was miserable. They'd married, as the old western hit said, "in a fever," unable to delay the wedding even one minute once they'd made the decision. Without telling either set of parents, they'd raced to Reno, gotten the license, found a preacher and afterward headed straight for a hotel room.<br><br>They were young and healthy and very much in love. Justine had known Seth nearly her entire life. He'd been her twin brother's best friend&#x2014;until Jordan drowned at age thirteen. Justine and Seth had been in the same high-school graduating class. In the ten years that followed, he'd lived in Cedar Cove but they hadn't been in contact until recently, when they'd both reluctantly joined the committee planning their class reunion.<br><br>At the time, Justine had been dating Warren Saget, a local developer. Warren was quite a few years older than Justine; in fact, he was just a little younger than her own father. Warren liked having a beautiful woman on his arm and Justine suited him perfectly. It helped that she was willing to keep his little secret&#x2014;while he might be successful in the boardroom, his powers didn't extend to the bedroom. When they were together, she often spent the night at his plush hillside house overlooking the cove, but that was more for show than anything. She had her own bedroom in Warren's home. Justine knew very well what people thought, but she'd never much cared.<br><br>However, her mother did. Olivia Lockhart shared the general assumptions about her arrangement with Warren and had plenty of opinions on the matter. Justine didn't enlighten her because it was none of Olivia's business. This disagreement between them had put a strain on the mother-daughter relationship. Her grandmother hadn't been particularly pleased, either, but Charlotte wasn't nearly as open in her disapproval. No doubt hoping to distract her from Warren, her mother had encouraged Justine to date Seth&#x2014;although even Olivia had been shocked when Justine phoned to tell her she'd impulsively married him.<br><br>The marriage was practically as big a surprise to Justine as it was to her family. After a spat having to do with Warren, Seth had walked away from her. Justine couldn't let it end like that, not with Seth, and she'd gone to him, hoping to make amends. To say they'd settled their differences was something of an understatement.<br><br>After the wedding, they'd only had that one weekend before Seth had to return to Alaska. In the weeks since, she'd heard from him intermittently, but he couldn't call&#x2014;or receive calls&#x2014;while he was at sea, so their communications were few and far between.<br><br>Justine glanced at the time and tried to decide whether she should drive home and check the mail or not. If there was no letter, she'd feel depressed for the rest of the afternoon. On the other hand, if Seth did happen to send her a message, she'd be walking on clouds for days afterward. She needed a letter, a phone call, <em>anything</em> that would remind her she'd made the right choice in marrying him.

And when her worst fear is realized, she finds herself doubly cursed. She is overwhelmed by grief, and her property and rights are now legally in the hands of her nearest male relative: her daughter's overbearing husband, whom Lyddie cannot abide. Lyddie decides to challenge both law and custom for control of her destiny, but she soon discovers the price of her bold "war" for personal freedom to be heartbreakingly dear. </p> <p> Includes the fascinating "story behind the story" of <i>The Widow's War</i>, a map of colonial Brewster, and a driving tour of the village of Satucket. </p></p><p><p>A lifelong resident of New England,&nbsp;Sally Cabot Gunning&nbsp;has immersed herself in its history from a young age. She is the author of the critically acclaimed Satucket Novels&#x2014;<em>The Widow&#x2019;s War, Bound</em>, and <em>The Rebellion of Jane Clarke</em>&#x2014;and, writing as Sally Cabot, the equally acclaimed <em>Benjamin Franklin&#x2019;s Bastard</em>. She lives in Brewster, Massachusetts, with her husband, Tom.</p>With all the recent talk about the illicit use of fiction in nonfiction, little has been said about the reverse: the occasional necessity or desire to report real events in a novel. History may provide the underpinning upon which a novel is based, or fiction may underscore an important character or event in a given era. Sally Gunning, in The Widow's War, seamlessly does both. Skillfully employing the language, imagination and character that literary fiction demands, she illuminates a fascinating moment in our past: the years just prior to the War of Independence, when ideas of rebellion -- for men and women -- were fomenting. Lyddie Berry becomes a widow on the day her husband responds to a cry of "Blackfish in the bay!" The view from the Berry house in Satucket Village (now Brewster on Cape Cod, Mass.) is all black whales, hundreds of them, being herded to shore. With hardly a backward glance, Lyddie's husband, Edward, runs down to the beach, never to return: His boat capsizes, and though the other four whalers aboard are saved, Berry is drowned. Before the day is over, Lyddie, no stranger to tragedy (she has already lost four of her five children), will be ousted from her house as is required by law and ensconced in the home of her son-in-law, Nathan Clarke, a man more interested in property than in women. Little time or language is wasted on grief. Sam Cowett, an Indian who lives as an Englishman and was the last to see Edward Berry alive, comes to pay his respects to the widow: "About your husband." " ... Yes." "I had him. A good grip. He was alive. I felt him take hold." "Yes. All right." "It tore." "What?" "The coat tore." "All right. Yes." Lyddie lives a life as austere as her speech. When removed from her house to reside with her daughter and husband, she is allowed to take only those precious few possessions she brought with her to the marriage. Clarke, as her nearest male relative, will receive title to all of the Berry property, while Lyddie, "as Edward's relict," is entitled to the "standard 'widow's third'" -- "a third of either the physical property itself or a third the interest resulting from its sale." Nathan, of course, wants to sell the property as soon as possible for the money. But Lyddie elects to return to and occupy her third of the house, setting up her own separate fire in the east corner of the keeping-room hearth, putting a bed in the southeast chamber and taking charge of the pantry. Clarke and the men around him are appalled. When Lyddie wonders why her husband didn't leave her more independent, his lawyer asks sarcastically if she would rather have been left alone. "How many months in the year was I alone?" she replies. "In spring my husband sailed for Carolina and in summer for Canada, in fall he went to Boston for weeks at a time.... Do you think I don't know how to be a woman alone?" Lyddie's act of rebellion may have been encouraged by the news of James Otis, a radical lawyer in Barnstable. Otis had challenged the Trade Acts by speaking out on behalf of the fundamental rights of man (and woman) -- principles, we are told in an afterword, on which future revolutionary activity was grounded. (John Adams later wrote, "Then and there the child Independence was born.") Lyddie's first bid for freedom inevitably leads to others. The widow not only refuses to attend church on the Sabbath, but she also breaks another law by working on that day, trying to sell cheese to make enough money to eat in her third of a house. Drawn to the household next door, Lyddie cares for Sam Cowett's wife, who is dying, and then attends to Cowett himself when he becomes ill. She receives pay in the form of food for these attentions and ignores the scandalized townspeople when she must occasionally spend the night in the Cowett house. Turning to Cowett for human warmth, Lyddie becomes the Indian's lover, further alienating herself from society -- and from her late husband's lawyer, who has proposed to her. Life with a wealthy, respected man is tempting, but she also knows that if she marries him, she will lose all rights to her "widow's third." The cost of her decision is high either way: "You're no mother to me or to my wife," Nathan Clarke shouts at her. "As of this day you're cut loose." A good novelist creates layer upon layer of reality so that when the central character makes an extraordinary leap, the reader is willing to go along. A fine balance, however, between detail and art must be struck. Too much research, and the word "research" might as well be stamped across the page. Too little, and the all-important quality of verisimilitude is lost. Gunning chooses her facts and details with care, allowing the strong-willed Lyddie to command our attention. One is revolted by the stink of the "try pots" (as is Lyddie) and thoroughly chilled by the cold ("First the well froze, then the clock, next the ink, and finally the bay, in great chunks"), but the grief, struggle and courage of this ordinary woman are what finally resonate. Many historical novels die on the page, the characters never having drawn breath. In Gunning's capable hands, a novel of history is allowed to be as vivid as the smell of a man: "Tobacco and sweat, but a different sweat, and something like sassafras but not sassafras." Anita Shreve's most recent novel is "A Wedding in December." Reviewed by Anita Shreve <br>Copyright 2006, The Washington Post.

Nobody in power wants to acknowledge this grim reality, but everyone knows it happens&#x2014;and that the torturers are the police. Three to five new claims are submitted to the Torture Inquiry and Relief Commission of Illinois each week. Four hundred cases are currently pending investigation. Between 1972 and 1991, at least 125 black suspects were tortured by Chicago police officers working under former Police Commander John Burge. As the more recent revelations from the Homan Square &#x201c;black site&#x201d; show, that brutal period is far from a historical anomaly. For more than fifty years, police officers who took an oath to protect and serve have instead beaten, electrocuted, suffocated, and raped hundreds&#x2014;perhaps thousands&#x2014;of Chicago residents.<br> &nbsp;<br> In <i>The Torture Letters</i>, Laurence Ralph chronicles the history of torture in Chicago, the burgeoning activist movement against police violence, and the American public&#x2019;s complicity in perpetuating torture at home and abroad. Engaging with a long tradition of epistolary meditations on racism in the United States, from James Baldwin&#x2019;s <i>The Fire Next Time </i>to Ta-Nehisi Coates&#x2019;s <i>Between the World and Me</i>, Ralph offers in this book a collection of open letters written to protesters, victims, students, and others. Through these moving, questing, enraged letters, Ralph bears witness to police violence that began in Burge&#x2019;s Area Two and follows the city&#x2019;s networks of torture to the global War on Terror. From Vietnam to Geneva to Guantanamo Bay&#x2014;Ralph&#x2019;s story extends as far as the legacy of American imperialism. Combining insights from fourteen years of research on torture with testimonies of victims of police violence, retired officers, lawyers, and protesters, this is a powerful indictment of police violence and a fierce challenge to all Americans to demand an end to the systems that support it.<br> &nbsp;<br> With compassion and careful skill, Ralph uncovers the tangled connections among law enforcement, the political machine, and the courts in Chicago, amplifying the voices of torture victims who are still with us&#x2014;and lending a voice to those long deceased.<br> &nbsp;</p><p><b>Laurence Ralph</b> is a professor of anthropology at Princeton University.

Kendi, National Book Award-winning author of Stamped from the Beginning</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;In this devastatingly powerful volume, Laurence deploys the epistolary method to reveal the results of fourteen years of meticulous research into the history of torture committed against people of color by the Chicago Police Department, focusing on incidents from the 1970s to the present. Through his impassioned open letters to victims, city officials, students of color, and others, Ralph brilliantly exposes the relationship between torture and racism in the United States through the horrific stories of those devastated by police violence. <i>The Torture Letters </i>is one of those extraordinary volumes whose contents are accessible to all readers, and I believe it is a necessary and important addition to the literature that measures the cost&#x2014;both economic, and, more importantly, human&#x2014;of police violence.&#x201d; (<i>Henry Louis Gates, Jr., author of Stony the Road: Reconstruction, White Supremacy, and the Rise of J</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;In this morally-urgent book, Ralph shines a critical light on acts that have too long remained in the shadows&#x2014;acts of cruelty, lawlessness, and cover-up. Investigative reporting blends with essay writing and ethnography to reveal a history of torture committed by the Chicago Police Department over the last several decades. We meet the officers who committed heinous acts and the men who survived them; members of the force who tried to do the right thing and those who turned blind eye; and young people organizing against police violence in all its forms. This is a novel and necessary read.&#x201d; (<i>Matthew Desmond, Pulitzer Prize-winning author of Evicted</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;A powerful and blunt reminder that regimes of torture persist not because of the exceptional depravity of a few but because of the passive complicity of many. In the tradition of Hannah Arendt, Ralph illustrates how unexceptional one need be to commit acts of great cruelty. At the same time, he honors those who have dedicated their lives to the radical acts of goodness that are necessary to undo tremendous harm committed be powerful people. Perhaps most importantly, with unabashed love and care, he invites us all to think critically about where we might find ourselves and how to fight the silences that create and maintain profoundly dehumanizing systems.&#x201d; (<i>Eve L. Ewing, author of Ghosts in the Schoolyard: Racism and School Closings on Chicago&#x2019;s South Side</i>)<br><br>"This is one of the most important books on our country's criminal legal system that I have ever read. Ralph shines a light on a part of the system that many have long refused to acknowledge and forces us to reckon with what has been done in our name. With this book Ralph has not only reasserted his status as one of our most rigorous researchers, but has further demonstrated that he is a brilliant writer, able to draw us into the lives of people across Chicago with compelling, empathetic prose. He has done all of us a great service by writing this book." (<i>Clint Smith, author of Counting Descent</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Infuriating, compassionate, and accessible, this book is a meditation on torture told through a series of letters. In <i>The Torture Letters</i>, Ralph searingly explores the costs of police violence to individuals and society while making sure to also center community resistance. It would be easy for a book about torture to be relentlessly harsh but there is hope to be found in the <i>Torture Letters</i>. That hope is in the people who refuse to be terrorized and silenced by brutality and violence.&#x201d; (<i>Mariame Kaba, founder &amp; director of Project NIA</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;As profound and luminous a book as I have read in years, in any genre, <i>The Torture Letters</i> calls us to an overdue reckoning with America&#x2019;s long-lasting history of racial violence and invites us to rebuild our world around a deep moral truth: No one deserves to be tortured, not even black and brown people, not even guilty black and brown people. As Ralph writes, &#x2018;Even the guilty have the right not to be electrocuted and raped; even the guilty have the right not to be suffocated and beaten within an inch of their lives.'" (<i>Danielle Allen, author of Cuz: The Life and Times of Michael A.</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;<i>The Torture Letters</i> is a brilliant, devastating and essential work. With a powerful narrative propulsion, Ralph unflinchingly confronts the history and present of police torture in American life, raising powerful questions about the nation we think we know, and its ideals of freedom, equality, due process, and justice. In the tradition of scholars like Michel Foucault and Frantz Fanon, who bridged critical theory, social criticism, and public intellectualism, something is revealed on these pages that can no longer be pushed aside. Ralph opens up the divergent meanings of being American, an identity which affords protection to some and sentences others to unearned and repeated brutality.&#x201d; (<i>Imani Perry, author of Looking for Lorraine: The Radiant Life of Lorraine Hansberry</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;&#x2019;Who wants to read a book about torture?&#x2019; I thought when I first confronted <i>The Torture Letters</i>. But from the very first paragraph I couldn&#x2019;t stop. Ralph uses his remarkable eyes, ears, mind, and heart as a prism onto human experience, allowing us to see affect, memory, structure, contingency, and possibility all at once.&nbsp;By writing letters he refuses the social scientist&#x2019;s phony perch of objectivity, choosing instead to expose the injustice and injuries that have been American democracy&#x2019;s most open and visible secret. These letters bring to bear the eloquence of truth.&nbsp;There is no looking away, no skipping ahead, no openings for titillation. Because we are not bystanders or voyeurs but accomplices in the&nbsp;legitimization of state violence as security. No more. Who needs to read this book about torture? Everyone.&#x201d; (<i>Robin D.

He is the top selling author of over forty-five books that have been translated into dozens of languages. Brian is happily married and has four children. He is active in community and national affairs, and is the President of three companies headquartered in Solana Beach, California.<b>Chapter 1</b><br><br><b>THE PSYCHOLOGY OF SELLING</b><br><br>Some salespeople always do well, no matter what is happening around them. They make excellent money, live in nice homes, drive new cars, and dine in fine restaurants. They always seem to have money in their pockets and in their bank accounts. Most of all, they are happy, optimistic, positive, friendly, relaxed, and seem to be in complete control of themselves and their lives. They are the top salespeople in every organization and their companies are dependent upon them for continued sales results.<br><br>Thousands of hours and millions of dollars have been spent studying the most successful salespeople in our society. They have been interviewed exhaustively, as have their customers, co-workers, and managers. Today as a result of this research, we know more about what it takes for you to be one of the best in your business than we have ever known before. And the most important thing we have learned in all these studies is that selling is more <i>psychological</i> than anything else.<br><br>One of the most important principles ever discovered in the field of human performance is called the "winning edge concept." This concept states that "small differences in ability can translate into enormous differences in results." What this means is that if you become just a little bit better in certain critical areas of selling, this slight improvement can translate into a substantial increase in your sales results. You may be on the verge of a major breakthrough in your sales career at this very moment by lust learning and practicing one small thing that is new and different from what you have done before. If a racehorse comes in first, even by a nose, it wins ten times the prize money of the horse that comes in second. Does this mean that the horse that wins by a nose is ten times <i>faster</i> than the horse that comes in second? Of course not! Is the horse that wins by a nose <i>twice</i> as fast, or 50 percent faster, or even 10 percent faster? The horse that wins is only a <i>nose</i> faster, but that translates into ten times the prize money.<br><br>By the same token, the salesperson who gets the sale for himself and his company gets 100 percent of the business and 100 percent of the commission. Does this mean that his product is 100 percent better than that of the competition, or 100 percent cheaper? Of course not! His product may not even be as good and it may cost more than that of the competitor, but the top salesman gets the sale nonetheless. The person who gets the sale is, in most cases, not a lot better than the person who loses the sale. He or she merely has the winning edge, but that's all it takes to get 100 percent of the business.<br><br>This concept is vital to your success. You may have heard of the Pareto Principle, the 80/20 rule, which, as it applies to sales, says that 80 percent of sales are made by 20 percent of the salespeople. Depending upon the sophistication of the industry and the overall level of training, the ratio can be 90/10 or 70/30, but in large national sales forces, the 80/20 rule holds true. Twenty percent of the salespeople make 80 percent of the sales and earn 80 percent of the commissions, while 80 percent of the salespeople make only 20 percent of the sales and share only 20 percent of the commissions.<br><br>What this means in dollar terms is remarkable! If ten salespeople are making a total of $1 million in sales in a given period, this means that two of the salespeople are making $800,000 of sales or approximately $400,000 each, and eight of the salespeople are making $200,000 of sales, or $25,000 each on average. This is a ratio of 16 to 1. The top salespeople are outselling the bottom salespeople by sixteen times!<br><br>This difference in sales results cannot be explained simply by sales technique and methodology. There is something else going on, and that something else is the mind-set or psychological state of the salesperson.<br><br>In every large company, it is common for some salespeople to be earning $25,000 a year while other salespeople are earning $250,000 a year, a difference of ten times. They are all selling the same product, to the same people, at the same price, under the same competitive conditions, into the same market, and out of the same office.<br><br>Is the person earning ten times as much as the other working ten times as hard, putting in ten times the number of hours? Does he or she see ten times the number of prospects?<br><br>Is it possible for the high-earning salesperson to be ten times better, in any area, than the person earning one tenth as much? Of course not.<br><br>In fact, sometimes the person earning ten times as much as the other salesperson in the office is younger, has less education, sees fewer people, works fewer hours, and has less experience than the long-term professional who is barely making a living.<br><br>This book will show you how to move into that top 10 percent of salespeople, to become one of the highest paid people in America, and to achieve all of your goals and dreams in this wonderful profession. And this requires, more than anything else, that you develop the winning psychological edge, which we will talk about through the rest of this chapter.<br><br><b>ATTITUDE VERSUS APTITUDE</b><br><br>The 80/20 rule is as applicable to individual salespeople as it is to large sales forces. Fully 80 percent of your success as a salesperson will be determined by your <i>attitude</i> and only 20 percent by your <i>aptitude.</i><br><br>A positive mental attitude, or a constructive and optimistic way of looking at yourself and your work, goes hand in hand with sales success in every field and in every market. Developing this attitude of unshakable self-confidence and enthusiasm, no matter what is going on around you, is your passport to greatness in selling.<br><br>The 20 percent of sales effectiveness that comes from product knowledge and professional selling skills is extremely important as well. It is only when you are thoroughly knowledgeable about what you are selling and thoroughly skilled in your ability to present it effectively that you develop the confidence and self-assurance upon which a positive mental attitude depends. We will talk more about this in later chapters, but for now, let's continue our discussion of attitude.<br><br><b>The quality of your thinking determines the quality of your life.</b> If you improve the quality of your thinking, in any area, you will improve the quality of your life in that area. By using your mind, your ability to think, you take charge of your life and determine your own destiny. You move from being powerless to being powerful. You determine everything that happens to you by the way you think about it, in advance. You may not be what you think you are, but what you think, you are!<br><br>The most rapid and positive changes in your personality and your sales results come about when you change your thinking about yourself and your possibilities. When you reprogram your subconscious mind so you feel a sense of personal power and control, every part of your life begins improving immediately. As William James of Harvard wrote in 1905, "The greatest revolution of my generation is the discovery that individuals, by changing their inner attitudes of mind, can change the outer aspects of their lives."<br><br>The very best salespeople have an attitude of calm, confident, positive self-expectation. They feel good about themselves and they have a quiet faith that everything they are doing is contributing toward their inevitable success. They are relaxed about their lives and their careers. They know, in their hearts, that they are good at what they do, and their customers know it as well. Often, their customers decide to buy from them even before they've made a sales presentation or described their product or service. They are the champions of selling everywhere. And because of the Law of Cause and Effect, you can become one of them by developing the same attitudes and attributes that they have.<br><br><b>SELF-CONCEPT: THE MASTER PROGRAM OF PERFORMANCE</b><br><br>One of the greatest breakthroughs in human performance and effectiveness in the twentieth century is the discovery of the <b>self-concept.</b> Your self-concept is the bundle of beliefs that you have about yourself and your world. It is the master program of your subconscious computer. These beliefs began forming with your very first experiences as an infant. Over the years, you have absorbed a complex series interwoven ideas, doubts, fears, opinions, attitudes, values, expectations, hopes, phobias, myths, and other impressions. You have taken them into your mind and accepted them as true. These are the operating instructions of your subconscious computer and they control everything that you say, do, think, and feel. In the absence of any deliberate change on your part, you will continue doing, thinking, saying, and feeling very much the same things indefinitely.<br><br>Just as you have an overall self-concept, or composite idea of who you are and what you can do, you also have a <b>mini-self-concept</b> for each individual part of your life. These mini-self-concepts determine how you think, feel, and perform with regard to people, sports, health, relationships, work, learning, creativity, and everything else you do.<br><br>You have a mini-self-concept for how much money you earn, as well. Whether or not you are happy with your income, it is the amount you have programmed yourself to earn, based on your past earnings and your current belief system. It is your self-concept level of income. It is the cumulative total of all your experiences with earning money since you got your first job. It is a part of your subconscious programming, and you tend to earn that amount even if you change jobs or move to another city. It is locked in.<br><br>In fact, this self-concept level of income is so deeply ingrained that if you earn much more or less than your current level of income, you will feel distinctly uncomfortable. Even <i>thinking</i> about earning substantially more or less than you're accustomed to will make you uneasy.<br><br>For example, if you earn 10 percent or more above this level, you will do everything possible to get rid of the money. You will have an irresistible urge to go out and spend it, even splurge on buying something you don't need. If you earn more than you're comfortable with for any period of time, you will feel impelled to invest in things you know nothing about, lend it to people who won't pay it back, or even give it away.<br><br>If you earn <i>less</i> than your self-concept level of income, you will start engaging in scrambling behaviors to get your income back up into the range where you feel comfortable. You will start working longer and harder, and maybe upgrading your skills. You may consider second income opportunities, starting your own business, or think about getting a new job where you can earn more.<br><br>Any change, or even an attempt to change anything you are doing, makes you uncomfortable. By attempting to change, you move out of your <b>comfort zone.</b> You feel increasingly uneasy. You experience stress and tension. If the change is too extreme, your physical and mental health can be affected. You will experience sleeplessness, indigestion, or fatigue. You may react with impatience, irritability or anger. You will often feel as if you are on an emotional roller coaster.<br><br>So if you want to sell more and earn more, you must increase your self-concept level of income. You must increase the amount you believe yourself capable of earning. You must raise your aspirations, set higher goals, and make detailed plans to achieve them. You must begin to see yourself and think about yourself as capable of being one of the highest earning salespeople in your field. You must take charge of developing a new self-concept for sales and income that is more consistent with what you really want to accomplish.<br><br>Your self-concept determines your levels of performance and effectiveness in everything you do. In sales, you have mini-self-concepts that govern every activity of selling. You have mini-self-concepts for prospecting, for cold calling, for making appointments, for presenting, for closing, for getting referrals, and for making follow-up sales. You have a mini-self-concept for your level of product knowledge, your personal management skills, your level of motivation, and for the way you relate to different types of customers. In every case, you will always perform in a manner consistent with the way you see yourself.<br><br>Wherever you have a high self-concept, you perform well. If you enjoy working on the telephone, you look forward to telephone prospecting and selling, and you do it well. If you have a high self-concept for making presentations or for closing sales, you feel comfortable and competent whenever you are doing them.<br><br>Wherever you feel tense or uneasy in selling, it means that you have a low self-concept in that area. You do not feel comfortable when you are engaged in that activity. You probably avoid that activity as much as possible.<br><br>If you are not particularly skilled at a particular activity, you will feel uncomfortable at the very thought of it. If you are not good on the telephone, you will avoid the telephone as much as possible. If you are not good at prospecting, you will avoid prospecting as much as possible. If you are not good at confirming the sale and closing the order, you will choke up at the end of the sales presentation and avoid asking for a commitment from the prospect. In each case, your income and your sales will suffer until you decide to change.<br><br>Some years ago, a young man in one of my seminars told me how moving out of his comfort zone was affecting him. He had come from a small farming community and he was selling large, expensive satellite dishes to wealthy farmers who had just had an excellent harvest. The winter was coming and they wanted television during the cold months ahead. The satellite dishes were new at the time and popular, and he was selling two a week, earning $1,000 commission on each one.<br><br>He told me that he had never made so much money in his whole life. His problem was that, after his second sale of the week, he experienced a form of withdrawal, accompanied by a desire to flee. He said that he was so overwhelmed by the amount of money he was making that he would go home after the week's second sale, close all the blinds in his bedroom, and lie on his bed in the darkness for several hours. This was his comfort zone.<br><br>Whenever you feel any kind of stress in selling, your natural tendency will also be to return to your comfort zone, at a lower level of performance, rather than to continue at what you're doing until you feel comfortable at that new level. Sometimes this discomfort, which can lead to self-sabotage, is mislabeled the "fear of success." But what it really is is the experience of attempting to achieve at a level beyond what you really believe is possible for you.<br><br>It is no surprise, then, that the top salespeople have high self-concepts in every phase of the selling process. They make most of the money that is paid in the sales profession. They are the most respected and esteemed people within their organizations and by the customers they call on. Their high, positive self-concepts for selling translate into excellent sales results and great lives for themselves and their families.<br><br><b>YOUR MENTAL MAKEUP: SELF-IDEAL, SELF-IMAGE, SELF-ESTEEM</b><br><br>Your self-concept is made up of three parts, each of which affects the others. When you understand the roles of these three aspects of your mental makeup, you can then put your hands on the keyboard of your own mental computer and change your programming.

Female disciples were frequently described as devout believers who eagerly served and sacrificed as they followed Christ. Amid repressive traditions that so often marginalized or restricted women to lesser roles, Jesus saw them as individuals with agency to choose how they would use their unique gifts.<p> In this well-researched and richly-illustrated companion volume to Women of the Old Testament, author Camille Fronk Olson focuses on many of these remarkable women and explores how they were influenced by Jesus Christ and His gospel. From His beloved mother, to a quiet woman in a crowd, to two sisters both desiring to serve the Lord in their own way, each bore a powerful witness of the Savior before and during His earthly ministry. Others, like Lydia, Phebe, and Prisca, helped to proclaim truth and spread the gospel after His Resurrection. With a Points to Ponder section at the end of each chapter and exquisite paintings created especially for this volume, Women of the New Testament provides a unique look at women whose examples of faith and devotion still inspire us today.</p></p><p>Camille Fronk Olson is the department chair of ancient scripture at Brigham Young University.

Imaginary characters weave through the lives of actual persons and events, blending fiction and non-fiction, magic and fantasy, into the profound realization of the interconnectedness of all beings. The tales highlight the importance of "true seeing" and focuses on transcendence rather than anguish. Above all <i>The Dragon Prince</i> simply contains well-told stories with clear and lyrical writing, once again giving testament to Thich Nhat Hanh's immense skill as a writer. This book is a must for every collection.<br><br>From the afterword by translator Mobi Warren:<br><br>"The heroes and heroines of these stories celebrate closeness to the Earth, the importance of assuming personal responsibility for one's conduct, and the possibility of resolving conflict through understanding rather than violence".

That moment, however, is short-lived: a horrid, gelatinous creature suddenly appears and gores Rick with a barbed tentacle. With his dying breath, Rick gurgles, &#x201c;It's starting.&#x201d; A few dimension-hops later and another Rick and Morty are traveling to the only Rick-free corner of the multiverse to wait out the massacre of all Ricks. But is a universe with only a Morty as safe as it might sound? As in the first volume, nihilistic jokes and obscure pop culture references abound, but the absurdity of those over-the-top allusions is always played for laughs. Questions of causality and ethics arise, but they are gleefully thrown aside in favor of crude irreverence and candy-colored vulgarity. Cannon's artwork nicely replicates the visual style of the cartoon, from Rick's drunken, wonky eyes to the grotesque interdimensional creatures that pepper the pages. Brainy older teens with slightly twisted senses of humor will appreciate this.<br></p><h2>Honeybee: Poems &amp; Short Prose</h2><p><p>Honey. Beeswax. Pollinate. Hive. Colony. Work. Dance.

What if embracing authentic Christianity is a journey of unlearning? Welcome to Jim Palmer's world!</p><p>Don Miller meets Anne Lamott meets Brian McLaren in this tale of shedding religion and plunging into uncharted depths of knowing God. Jim Palmer, emergent pastor, shares his compelling off-road spiritual journey and the unsuspecting people who became his guides.</p><p>"Perhaps God's reason for wanting me," writes Palmer, "is much better than my reason for wanting him. Maybe God's idea of my salvation trumps the version I am too willing to settle for. Seeing I needed a little help to get this, God sent a variety pack of characters to awaken me." For all those hoping there's more to God and Christianity than what they've heard or experienced, each chapter of <i>Divine Nobodies</i> gives the reader permission and freedom to discover it for themselves. Sometimes comical, other times tragic, at times shocking, always honest; Jim Palmer's story offers an inspiring and profound glimpse into life with God beyond institutional church and conventional religion. </p><p>"I am tempted to say that Jim Palmer could well be the next Donald Miller, but what they have in common, along with an honest spirituality and extraordinary skill as storytellers, is a unique voice . . . Divine Nobodies is a delight to read, and it was good for my soul to read it." <br>-BRIAN MCLAREN<br>Author of <i>The Secret Message of Jesus</i></p><p>"You hold in your hands an amazing story of a broken man finding freedom in all the right places-in God's work in the lives of some extraordinarily ordinary people around him. You will thrill to this delightful blend of gut-wrenching honesty and laugh-out-loud hilarity, and in the end you'll find God much closer, the body of Christ far bigger and your own journey far clearer than you ever dreamed."<br>-WAYNE JACOBSEN<br>Author of Authentic Relationships </p></p><p><br> <br>Jim has a Master of Divinity degree and was a successful Senior Pastor before he left institutional church and organized religion to explore new dimensions of his relationship with God.

Jones examines the central question of our own war: how did an insurgency develop? Following the September 11 attacks, the United States successfully overthrew the Taliban regime. It established security throughout the country&#x2015;killing, capturing, or scattering most of al Qa&#x2019;ida&#x2019;s senior operatives&#x2015;and Afghanistan finally began to emerge from more than two decades of struggle and conflict. But Jones argues that as early as 2001 planning for the Iraq War siphoned off resources and talented personnel, undermining the gains that had been made. After eight years, he says, the United States has managed to push al Qa&#x2019;ida&#x2019;s headquarters about one hundred miles across the border into Pakistan, the distance from New York to Philadelphia.<br><br> While observing the tense and often adversarial relationship between NATO allies in the Coalition, Jones&#x2015;who has distinguished himself at RAND and was recently named by <em>Esquire</em> as one of the &#x201c;Best and Brightest&#x201d; young policy experts&#x2015;introduces us to key figures on both sides of the war. Harnessing important new research and integrating thousands of declassified government documents, Jones then analyzes the insurgency from a historical and structural point of view, showing how a rising drug trade, poor security forces, and pervasive corruption undermined the Karzai government, while Americans abandoned a successful strategy, failed to provide the necessary support, and allowed a growing sanctuary for insurgents in Pakistan to catalyze the Taliban resurgence.<br><br> Examining what has worked thus far&#x2015;and what has not&#x2015;this serious and important book underscores the challenges we face in stabilizing the country and explains where we went wrong and what we must do if the United States is to avoid the disastrous fate that has befallen many of the great world powers to enter the region. 12 maps and charts</p><p>Praise for In the Graveyard of Empires &#34;Seth Jones . . . has an anthropologist&#39;s feel for a foreign society, a historian&#39;s intuition for long-term trends, and a novelist&#39;s eye for the telling details that illuminate a much larger story.

But she found herself yearning for something she would eventually call God.<br><br><i>Surprised by God</i> is a memoir of a young woman's spiritual awakening and eventual path to the rabbinate, a story of integrating life on the edge of the twenty-first century into the discipline of traditional Judaism, without sacrificing either. It's also an unflinchingly honest guide to the kind of work that goes into developing a spiritual practice-and it shows why, perhaps, doing this in today's world requires more effort than ever.</p><p><b>Rabbi Danya Ruttenberg</b>&nbsp;is the author of <i>Suprised by God: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Religion</i> and 2016 National Jewish Book Award finalist <i>Nurture the Now: Finding Spirituality in the Frustration, Boredom, Tears, Poop, Desperation, Wonder, and Radical Amazement of Parenting</i> and editor of several books including <i>Yentl's Revenge: The Next Wave of Jewish Feminism.</i> She has been published in a wide variety of books and periodicals, including&nbsp;<i>Encyclopedia Judaica</i>,&nbsp;<i>Best Jewish Writing 2002</i>, the&nbsp;<i>San Francisco Chronicle</i>,&nbsp;<i>Salon</i>,&nbsp;<i>Bitchfest</i>, and&nbsp;<i>The Women's Movement Today: An Encyclopedia of Third-Wave Feminism</i>.

When we travel to a different country, or even a different city in the United States, we assume that a certain amount of cultural adjustment will be required, whether it's getting used to new food or negotiating a foreign language, adapting to a different standard of living or another currency. In fact, what contributes most to our sense of disorientation is having to adapt to another culture's sense of time.Levine, who has devoted his career to studying time and the pace of life, takes us on an enchanting tour of time through the ages and around the world. As he recounts his unique experiences with humor and deep insight, we travel with him to Brazil, where to be three hours late is perfectly acceptable, and to Japan, where he finds a sense of the long-term that is unheard of in the West. We visit communities in the United States and find that population size affects the pace of life and even the pace of walking. We travel back in time to ancient Greece to examine early clocks and sundials, then move forward through the centuries to the beginnings of &#x201d;clock time&#x201d; during the Industrial Revolution. We learn that there are places in the world today where people still live according to &#x201d;nature time,&#x201d; the rhythm of the sun and the seasons, and &#x201d;event time,&#x201d; the structuring of time around happenings(when you want to make a late appointment in Burundi, you say, &#x201d;I'll see you when the cows come in&#x201d;).Levine raises some fascinating questions. How do we use our time? Are we being ruled by the clock? What is this doing to our cities? To our relationships? To our own bodies and psyches? Are there decisions we have made without conscious choice? Alternative tempos we might prefer? Perhaps, Levine argues, our goal should be to try to live in a &#x201d;multitemporal&#x201d; society, one in which we learn to move back and forth among nature time, event time, and clock time. In other words, each of us must chart our own geography of time. If we can do that, we will have achieved temporal prosperity.</p><p><p><em>On time, out of time, time out, time is money--if our vernacular is any indication, the concept of time has certainly infiltrated American culture. Does <em>everybody</em> in the world share the same perception of time? In <em>A Geography of Time</em>, psychologist Robert Levine puts time to the test by sending teams of researchers all over the world to measure everything from the average walking speed to the time it takes to buy a stamp at the post office. Levine scatters his findings among engaging accounts of his own encounters with the various perceptions of time in different cultures. From the history of clocks to how people tell time today, <em>A Geography of Time</em> is jam-packed with "timely" information. <br></em></p><b>Robert Levine, Ph.D.,</b> is professor in the psychology department at California State University, Fresno, where he has also served as Department Chair and Associate Dean of the College of Science and Mathematics.&nbsp; He has received many awards for his teaching and research.

J. Niimi tells the story of the album's genesis - with fascinating input from Don Dixon and Mitch Easter. He also investigates Michael Stipe's hypnotic, mysterious lyrics, and makes the case for <i>Murmur </i>as a work of Southern Gothic art.</p><p><p>J. Niimi writes about music for the <i>Chicago Reader</i>, <i>SPIN</i>, City<i> Pages</i>, and<i> SF Weekly</i>, among other publications. In previous years he worked as a studio engineer, recorded eight albums as the drummer of Ashtray Boy, and hosted a weekly radio show on WHPK. He lives in Chicago with his wife and their two border terriers.</p>In the course of an interview that took place some twenty years ago, Michael Stipe made passing reference to an essay that had a deep impact on him. It&#x2019;s what came to his mind when, after having been harangued by fans and journalists alike about Murmur&#x2019;s lyrics, already grown weary from having to continually entertain their broad speculations, he finally threw up his hands. "Anyone who really wants to figure out the words to our songs should probably read this essay, then go back and listen," Stipe told the interviewer. "It talks about how people misinterpret something that&#x2019;s being said, and come up with a little phrase or word that actually defines the essence of what the original was better than the original did." What Stipe was trying to say is that if you want answers to R.E.M., you&#x2019;re not only looking in the wrong place, you&#x2019;re also asking the wrong questions.</p><h2>China Clipper: The Secret Pre-War Story of Pan American&#39;s Flying Boats</h2><p>The true story of Pan American's flying boats and their role in the war in the Pacific - based on over 6,900 previously undisclosed government and corporate documents. China Clipper is a gripping and revealing story that sheds new light on the events leading up to World War II. China Clipper is filled with fact but reads like a spy novel. China Clipper breaks new ground and garnered stellar reviews - &#x201c;... new theory on the mystery of the Hawaii Clipper...&#x201d; New York Times --- &#x201c;...compelling, even romantic...&#x201d; San Francisco Chronicle --- &#x201c;...this is exciting reading...&#x201d; San Diego Union --- &#x201c;...good tale for spy , aviation and WWII buffs...&#x201d; Nashville Banner In the 1930s the political stability of the U.S. was collapsing. The U.S. was dangerously vulnerable. Through a popular policy of isolationism and international treaty the U.S. had only the most rudimentary and feeble defenses for an inevitable war with Japan. Japan, on the other hand, was ruthlessly storming through Manchuria, Korea and China slaughtering millions. The U.S. was stymied but Pan American Airways' proposed commercial seaplane bases at Pearl Harbor, Midway, Wake, Guam and Manila (all attacked on December 7 and 8 1941) offered the perfect ruse to begin fortifying the Pacific in 1934. You'll discover how the government worked covertly with Pan American to build Pacific island defenses, how Pan American became a monopoly and powerhouse airline. While China Clipper can be read as an exciting war story based on true events, its major power lies in the unique recreation of people and events heretofore previously unknown. Tautly written, filled with vivid characterizations, China Clipper is a compelling and a frightening examination of the forces that eventually caused Pearl Harbor to explode - and - the world go to war. China Clipper also follows the day-by-day flight of American citizen and Chinese patriot, Wah Sun Choy, in July 1938 on the Hawaii Clipper bound for China. A successful New Jersey businessman, Wah Sun Choy had raised over $3 million to help bolster China's war with Japan. But his purpose - to deliver the money to the Chinese Nationalists - clashed with the avowed aims of Japan. Between Guam and Manila, the elegant flying boat completely disappeared. Why the 26-ton flying boat vanished and how is explored in depth - for the first time - in China Clipper.</p><p></p><h2>The Important Thing About Margaret Wise Brown</h2><p><p><strong>An&nbsp;exceptional&nbsp;picture book biography of Margaret Wise Brown, the legendary author of <em>Goodnight Moon</em>,&nbsp;<em>The Runaway Bunny,</em>&nbsp;and other beloved children&#x2019;s classics, that's as&nbsp;groundbreaking&nbsp;as the icon herself was&#x2014;from award-winning, bestselling author Mac Barnett and acclaimed illustrator Sarah Jacoby.</strong></p><p>What is important about Margaret Wise Brown?</p><p>In&nbsp;forty-two inspired pages, this biography&nbsp;artfully plays with form and language to vivdly bring to life one of greatest children&#x2019;s book creators who ever lived: Margaret Wise Brown.</p><p>Illustrated with sumptuous art by rising star Sarah Jacoby, this is essential reading for book lovers of every age.</p></p><p><p><em>What is important about Margaret Wise Brown?</em></p><p>In 42 inspired pages, this biography by award-winning writer Mac Barnett vividly depicts one of the greatest children&#x2019;s book creators who ever lived: Margaret Wise Brown, the author of <em>Goodnight Moon</em>, <em>The Runaway Bunny</em>, and <em>The Little Fur Family</em>.

With a criminal empire that stretched from the Gulf Coast throughout the Caribbean, Trafficante was linked to drug trafficking, plots to kill Fidel Castro, and the assassination of JFK. Scott M. Deitche scoured court records, law-enforcement reports, newspaper accounts, and conducted dozens of interviews to find the compelling story of this enigmatic Mafioso don.</p><p>Although this sprawling, well-referenced Mob bio is nominally about Santo Trafficante Jr., Deitche necessarily starts with Santo Sr., who flew under law enforcement's radar and took advantage of his early rivals' bloody squabbling to create the organized crime empire he eventually handed over to his namesake. Both Trafficantes so adeptly dodged publicity that Deitche was hard-pressed to find significant documentation of Sr.'s activities before his 1930s emergence as the Tampa, Florida, Mafia boss. At the time when Luciano, Lansky, and Capone moved away from ethnic divisions within gangs, the Trafficante crew remained Sicilian-dominated. Maintaining close ties to New York's Five Families and Chicago's Outfit, Santo Jr.'s organization participated in most major Mob high jinks of the latter twentieth century, including leadership roles in such alleged CIA-Mob partnerships as the Bay of Pigs invasion and assassination plots involving Castro and JFK. Deitche presents the sprawling Trafficante story in luscious detail and appends a bulging bibliography of related material. This excellent gangster study handily fills a big gap in Mob literature. <i>Mike Tribby</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

It&#x2019;s time for the greedy to answer for the lives of innocents.Meanwhile, a man is found tied to a burning boat in the middle of the bay, and Maggie&#x2019;s instincts tell her Bennett Boudreaux is behind it. But if he is, Maggie has to decide whether she really wants him punished, or if justice has already been served.<strong> Vengeance is afoot in Apalachicola, and everyone is in its path. </strong><p><b>Editorial Reviews</b></p><p><b>From Low Tide, Book 1 of The Forgotten Coast Florida Suspense Series</b></p><strong><i>"Yeah, you'd better buckle up."</i>Ms. McKenna is able to introduce you to a character and make them so lifelike and real, that you're certain she's telling you about someone she knows very well. I understand there will be several more in this series coming in rapid fire succession, so read fast. I see nothing but success for this author, she's definitely found her corner with the Forgotten Coast series. Florida writers need to watch out, or better still read Dawn McKenna's books. She's the real deal.......Wayne Stinnett, author of the bestsellingJesse McDermitt Caribbean Adventure series</strong></p><p>I was born and raised in Florida and now live in Tennessee. The South is as much a main character in my books as any of the people that populate them. From dirt roads in Alabama to coastal fishing towns in the Florida Panhandle, the south is so wonderfully filled with atmosphere and interesting people that I don&#39;t really see any reason for my writing to leave home. I write the occasional literary or women&#39;s fiction book, but my time is focused right now on The Forgotten Coast Florida series. This series, set in Apalachicola, FL, is a noirish suspense series, dripping with atmosphere and flawed, human, witty characters. The first four books in the series have an overarcing story that isn&#39;t resolved until book four (Landfall, releasing at the end of July 2015), but also subplots and mayhem and overall sinister dealings that are resolved in each book. The first four books are a foundation for the rest of the series, which will serve more as standalone novels. Whether you&#39;re reading See You or one of the Forgotten Coast books, you&#39;ll find they have in common dry humor, a good deal of atmosphere and characters who are people, rather than caricatures. I love these people, from 90-year old Creole nanny Miss Evangeline, to the droll and honorable Jack Canfield, to strong but damaged cop Maggie Redmond, and even the hilariously inappropriate and dangerously charming bad guy, Bennett Boudreaux. I hope that you&#39;ll meet them all, and love them all as I do.</p><h2>The Preemie Primer: A Complete Guide for Parents of Premature Babies--from Birth through the Toddler Years and Beyond</h2><p>Having a premature baby&#x2014;a baby born before the thirty-seventh week of pregnancy&#x2014; can be a crash course in both medicine and health economics, not just in parenting. Parents face complex information, difficult decisions, and overwhelming grief and worry&#x2014;with challenges that often extend well beyond those early days and weeks. As an ob/gyn, Dr. Jennifer Gunter has delivered hundreds of premature babies, but as a mother of preemie triplets, she also understands the heartbreak and challenges of prematurity. <i>The Preemie Primer</i> is a comprehensive resource, covering topics from delivery, hospitalization, and preemie development to parenting multiples, handling health issues, and finding special-needs programs. Compassionate, engaging, and medically grounded, <i>The Preemie Primer</i> is the first book on prematurity to combine the insight of a doctor with the experience of a mom.</p><p><b>Jennifer Gunter, MD,</b> is an internationally renowned ob/gyn and leading expert in the field of women's pain medicine. She lives in Mill Valley, California.&#x201c;In addition to containing the latest information about prematurity, <i>The Preemie Primer</i> is unique because the author is unique. The book is written from Dr. Gunter's perspective as both an obstetrician and the parent of preemies...This combination of medical knowledge and a parent's intuition make <i>The Preemie Primer</i> a special book...What <i>The Preemie Primer</i> does best is to explain the complicated world of NICU care for premature babies in words that parents can understand...Unlike a lot of books on prematurity, <i>The Preemie Primer</i> doesn't end at NICU discharge. Dr. Gunter does a wonderful job of helping parents cope with the difficult transition from NICU to home, and to understand the challenges that children born early may face as they grow from babies to toddlers, then enter the school system.&#x201d;&nbsp;<b>MamasOnBedrest&amp;Beyond.com, 9/2/10</b>&#x201c;A deeply personal account...The success of <i>The Preemie Primer</i> results from the fact that as I read it, I felt as if I was sitting across from Jennifer Gunter, drinking coffee and chatting as she tells her story.&#x201d;&nbsp;<b><i>Library Journal</i></b><b>, 9/16/10</b><b>(starred review)</b><br><br><b>Stephen Berman, MD, FAAP, Professor of Pediatrics, University Colorado School of Medicine, Past President American Academy of Pediatrics</b><br> &#x201c;As a pediatrician who cares for children with complex medical conditions, many of whom were born very prematurely, I recommend <i>The Preemie Primer</i> as a must-read for families of preemies. Caring for these fragile infants and children requires a partnership with parents and joint clinical decision making, a partnership that will be strengthened when parents read this book.

An essential and often overlooked part of pain rehabilitation is listening to, working with, learning from, and validating the person in pain&#39;s lived experience. The book expounds on the movement to a more patient-valued, partnership-based biopsychosocial-spiritual model of healthcare where the patient is an active and empowered participant, as opposed to a model where the healthcare provider is &#39;fixing&#39; the passive patient.

She is best known for&nbsp;<i>Little Women</i>&nbsp;(1968), which is loosely based on her own life and proved to be one of the most popular children&#x2019;s books ever written. Three sequels followed:&nbsp;<i>Good Wives</i>&nbsp;(1869),&nbsp;<i>Little Men </i>(1871), and&nbsp;<i>Jo&#x2019;s Boys</i>&nbsp;(1886). Alcott was the daughter of the famous transcendentalist Bronson Alcott and was friend of Emerson and Thoreau. In addition to writing, she worked as a teacher, governess, and Civil War nurse, as well as being an advocate of abolition, women&#x2019;s rights, and temperance. She died in 1888 and is buried in Sleepy Hollow cemetery in Concord, Massachusetts.Chapter One: Gossip CHAPTER ONE Gossip <br>IN ORDER THAT WE MAY start afresh, and go to Meg&#x2019;s wedding with free minds, it will be well to begin with a little gossip about the Marches. And here let me premise, that if any of the elders think there is too much &#x201c;lovering&#x201d; in the story, as I fear they may (I&#x2019;m not afraid the young folks will make that objection), I can only say with Mrs. March, &#x201c;What <i>can</i> you expect when I have four girls in the house, and a dashing young neighbor over the way?&#x201d;<br> <br>The three years that have passed have brought but few changes to the quiet family. The war is over, and Mr. March safely at home, busy with his books and the small parish which found in him a minister by nature as by grace&#x2013;a quiet, studious man, rich in the wisdom that is better than learning, the charity which calls all mankind &#x201c;brother,&#x201d; the piety that blossoms into character, making it august and lovely.<br> <br>These attributes, in spite of poverty and the strict integrity, which shut him out from the more worldly successes, attracted to him many admirable persons, as naturally as sweet herbs draw bees, and as naturally he gave them the honey into which fifty years of hard experience had distilled no bitter drop. Earnest young men found the gray-headed scholar as young at heart as they; thoughtful or troubled women instinctively brought their doubts and sorrows to him, sure of finding the gentlest sympathy, the wisest counsel; sinners told their sins to the pure-hearted old man, and were both rebuked and saved; gifted men found a companion in him; ambitious men caught glimpses of nobler ambitions than their own; and even worldlings confessed that his beliefs were beautiful and true, although &#x201c;they wouldn&#x2019;t pay.&#x201d;<br> <br>To outsiders, the five energetic women seemed to rule the house, and so they did in many things; but the quiet scholar, sitting among his books, was still the head of the family, the household conscience, anchor, and comforter for to him the busy, anxious women always turned in troublous times, finding him, in the truest sense of those sacred words, husband and father.<br> <br>The girls gave their hearts into their mother&#x2019;s keeping, their souls into their father&#x2019;s; and to both parents, who lived and labored so faithfully for them, they gave a love that grew with their growth, and bound them tenderly together by the sweetest tie which blesses life and outlives death.<br> <br>Mrs. March is as brisk and cheery, though rather grayer, than when we saw her last, and just now so absorbed in Meg&#x2019;s affairs that the hospitals and homes, still full of wounded &#x201c;boys&#x201d; and soldiers&#x2019; widows, decidedly miss the motherly missionary&#x2019;s visits.<br> <br>John Brooke did his duty manfully for a year, got wounded, was sent home, and not allowed to return. He received no stars or bars, but he deserved them, for he cheerfully risked all he had; and life and love are very precious when both are in full bloom. Perfectly resigned to his discharge, he devoted himself to getting well, preparing for business, and earning a home for Meg. With the good sense and sturdy independence that characterized him, he refused Mr. Laurence&#x2019;s more generous offers, and accepted the place of bookkeeper, feeling better satisfied to begin with an honestly earned salary than by running any risks with borrowed money.<br> <br>Meg had spent the time in working as well as waiting, growing womanly in character, wise in housewifely arts, and prettier than ever; for love is a great beautifier. She had her girlish ambitions and hopes, and felt some disappointment at the humble way in which the new life must begin. Ned Moffat had just married Sallie Gardiner, and Meg couldn&#x2019;t help contrasting their fine house and carriage, many gifts, and splendid outfit, with her own, and secretly wishing she could have the same. But somehow envy and discontent soon vanished when she thought of all the patient love and labor John had put into the little home awaiting her; and when they sat together in the twilight, talking over their small plans, the future always grew so beautiful and bright that she forgot Sallie&#x2019;s splendor, and felt herself the richest, happiest girl in Christendom.<br> <br>Jo never went back to Aunt March, for the old lady took such a fancy to Amy that she bribed her with the offer of drawing lessons from one of the best teachers going; and for the sake of this advantage Amy would have served a far harder mistress. So she gave her mornings to duty, her afternoons to pleasure, and prospered finely. Jo, meantime, devoted herself to literature and Beth, who remained delicate, long after the fever was a thing of the past. Not an invalid exactly, but never again the rosy, healthy creature she had been, yet always hopeful, happy, and serene, busy with the quiet duties she loved, everyone&#x2019;s friend, and an angel in the house, long before those who loved her most had learned to know it.<br> <br>As long as the <i>Spread Eagle</i> paid her a dollar a column for her &#x201c;rubbish,&#x201d; as she called it, Jo felt herself a woman of means, and spun her little romances diligently. But great plans fermented in her busy brain and ambitious mind, and the old tin kitchen in the garret held a slowly increasing pile of blotted manuscript, which was one day to place the name of March upon the roll of fame.<br> <br>Laurie, having dutifully gone to college to please his grandfather, was now getting through it in the easiest possible manner to please himself. A universal favorite, thanks to money, manners, much talent, and the kindest heart that ever got its owner into scrapes by trying to get other people out of them, he stood in great danger of being spoiled, and probably would have been, like many another promising boy, if he had not possessed a talisman against evil in the memory of the kind old man who was bound up in his success, the motherly friend who watched over him as if he were her son, and last, but not least by any means, the knowledge that four innocent girls loved, admired, and believed in him with all their hearts.<br> <br>Being only &#x201c;a glorious human boy,&#x201d; of course he frolicked and flirted, grew dandified, aquatic, sentimental, or gymnastic, as college fashions ordained; hazed and was hazed, talked slang, and more than once came perilously near suspension and expulsion. But as high spirits and the love of fun were the causes of these pranks, he always managed to save himself by frank confession, honorable atonement, or the irresistible power of persuasion which he possessed in perfection. In fact, he rather prided himself on his narrow escapes, and liked to thrill the girls with graphic accounts of his triumphs over wrathful tutors, dignified professors, and vanquished enemies. The &#x201c;men of my class,&#x201d; were heroes in the eyes of the girls, who never wearied of the exploits of &#x201c;our fellows,&#x201d; and were frequently allowed to bask in the smiles of these great creatures, when Laurie brought them home with him.<br> <br>Amy especially enjoyed this high honor, and became quite a belle among them; for her ladyship early felt and learned to use the gift of fascination with which she was endowed. Meg was too much absorbed in her private and particular John to care for any other lords of creation, and Beth too shy to do more than peep at them, and wonder how Amy dared to order them about so; but Jo felt quite in her element, and found it very difficult to refrain from imitating the gentlemanly attitudes, phrases, and feats, which seemed more natural to her than the decorums prescribed for young ladies. They all liked Jo immensely, but never fell in love with her, though very few escaped without paying the tribute of a sentimental sigh or two at Amy&#x2019;s shrine. And speaking of sentiment brings us very naturally to the &#x201c;Dovecote.&#x201d;<br> <br>That was the name of the little brown house which Mr. Brooke had prepared for Meg&#x2019;s first home. Laurie had christened it, saying it was highly appropriate to the gentle lovers, who &#x201c;went on together like a pair of turtledoves, with first a bill and then a coo.&#x201d; It was a tiny house, with a little garden behind and a lawn about as big as a pocket handkerchief in front. Here Meg meant to have a fountain, shrubbery, and a profusion of lovely flowers; though just at present, the fountain was represented by a weather-beaten urn, very like a dilapidated slop bowl; the shrubbery consisted of several young larches, undecided whether to live or die; and the profusion of flowers was merely hinted by regiments of sticks, to show where seeds were planted. But inside, it was altogether charming, and the happy bride saw no fault from garret to cellar. To be sure, the hall was so narrow, it was fortunate that they had no piano, for one never could have been got in whole; the dining room was so small that six people were a tight fit; and the kitchen stairs seemed built for the express purpose of precipitating both servants and china pell-mell into the coal bin. But one gets used to these slight blemishes, and nothing could be more complete, for good sense and good taste had presided over the furnishing, and the result was highly satisfactory. There were no marble-topped tables, long mirrors, or lace curtains in the little parlor, but simple furniture, plenty of books, a fine picture or two, a stand of flowers in the bay window, and, scattered all about, the pretty gifts which came from friendly hands, and were the fairer for the loving messages they brought.<br> <br>I don&#x2019;t think the Parian Psyche Laurie gave lost any of its beauty because John put up the bracket it stood upon; that any upholsterer could have draped the plain muslin curtains more gracefully than Amy&#x2019;s artistic hand; or that any storeroom was ever better provided with good wishes, merry words, and happy hopes than that in which Jo and her mother put away Meg&#x2019;s few boxes, barrels, and bundles; and I am morally certain that the spandy new kitchen never <i>could</i> have looked so cozy and neat if Hannah had not arranged every pot and pan a dozen times over, and laid the fire all ready for lighting, the minute &#x201c;Mis. Brooke came home.&#x201d; I also doubt if any young matron ever began life with so rich a supply of dusters, holders, and piece bags; for Beth made enough to last till the silver wedding came around, and invented three different kinds of dishcloths for the express service of the bridal china.<br> <br>People who hire all these things done for them never know what they lose; for the homeliest tasks get beautified if loving hands do them, and Meg found so many proofs of this, that everything in her small nest, from the kitchen roller to the silver vase on her parlor table was eloquent of home love and tender forethought.<br> <br>What happy times they had planning together, what solemn shopping excursions; what funny mistakes they made, and what shouts of laughter arose over Laurie&#x2019;s ridiculous bargains. In his love of jokes, this young gentleman, though nearly through college, was as much of a boy as ever. His last whim had been to bring with him, on his weekly visits, some new, useful, and ingenious article for the young housekeeper. Now a bag of remarkable clothespins; next, a wonderful nutmeg grater, which fell to pieces at the first trial; a knife cleaner that spoiled all the knives; or a sweeper that picked the nap neatly off the carpet, and left the dirt; labor-saving soap that took the skin off one&#x2019;s hands; infallible cements which stuck firmly to nothing but the fingers of the deluded buyer; and every kind of tinware, from a toy savings bank for odd pennies, to a wonderful boiler which would wash articles in its own steam, with every prospect of exploding in the process.<br> <br>In vain Meg begged him to stop. John laughed at him, and Jo called him &#x201c;Mr. Toodles.&#x201d; He was possessed with a mania for patronizing Yankee ingenuity, and seeing his friends fitly furnished forth. So each week beheld some fresh absurdity.<br> <br>Everything was done at last, even to Amy&#x2019;s arranging different colored soaps to match the different colored rooms, and Beth&#x2019;s setting the table for the first meal.<br> <br>&#x201c;Are you satisfied? Does it seem like home, and do you feel as if you should be happy here?&#x201d; asked Mrs. March, as she and her daughter went through the new kingdom, arm in arm for just then they seemed to cling together more tenderly than ever.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, Mother, perfectly satisfied, thanks to you all, and <i>so</i> happy that I can&#x2019;t talk about it,&#x201d; answered Meg, with a look that was better than words.<br> <br>&#x201c;If she only had a servant or two it would be all right,&#x201d; said Amy, coming out of the parlor, where she had been trying to decide whether the bronze Mercury looked best on the whatnot or the mantlepiece.<br> <br>&#x201c;Mother and I have talked that over, and I have made up my mind to try her way first. There will be so little to do, that, with Lotty to run my errands and help me here and there, I shall only have enough work to keep me from getting lazy or homesick,&#x201d; answered Meg tranquilly.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sallie Moffat has four,&#x201d; began Amy.<br> <br>&#x201c;If Meg had four the house wouldn&#x2019;t hold them, and master and missis would have to camp in the garden,&#x201d; broke in Jo, who, enveloped in a big blue pinafore, was giving the last polish to the door handles.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sallie isn&#x2019;t a poor man&#x2019;s wife, and many maids are in keeping with her fine establishment. Meg and John begin humbly, but I have a feeling that there will be quite as much happiness in the little house as in the big one. It&#x2019;s a great mistake for young girls like Meg to leave themselves nothing to do but dress, give orders, and gossip. When I was first married I used to long for my new clothes to wear out or get torn, so that I might have the pleasure of mending them, for I got heartily sick of doing fancywork and tending my pocket handkerchief.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Why didn&#x2019;t you go into the kitchen and make messes, as Sallie says she does, to amuse herself, though they never turn out well, and the servants laugh at her,&#x201d; said Meg.<br> <br>&#x201c;I did, after a while; not to &#x201c;mess,&#x201d; but to learn of Hannah how things should be done, that my servants need <i>not</i> laugh at me. It was play then but there came a time when I was truly grateful that I not only possessed the will but the power to cook wholesome food for my little girls, and help myself when I could no longer afford to hire help. You begin at the other end, Meg, dear; but the lessons you learn now will be of use to you by and by, when John is a richer man, for the mistress of a house, however splendid, should know how work ought to be done, if she wishes to be well and honestly served.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, Mother, I&#x2019;m sure of that,&#x201d; said Meg, listening respectfully to the little lecture; for the best of women will hold forth upon the all-absorbing subject of housekeeping. &#x201c;Do you know I like this room most of all in my baby house,&#x201d; added Meg, a minute after, as they went upstairs, and she looked into her well-stored linen closet.<br> <br>Beth was there, laying the snowy piles smoothly on the shelves, and exulting over the goodly array. All three laughed as Meg spoke; for that linen closet was a joke. You see, having said that if Meg married &#x201c;that Brooke&#x201d; she shouldn&#x2019;t have a cent of her money, Aunt March was rather in a quandary, when time had appeased her wrath and made her repent her vow. She never broke her word, and was much exercised in her mind how to get around it, and at last devised a plan whereby she could satisfy herself. Mrs. Carrol, Florence&#x2019;s mamma, was ordered to buy, have made, and marked, a generous supply of house and table linen, and send it as <i>her</i> present, all of which was faithfully done; but the secret leaked out, and was grea...</p><h2>Changing the Conversation: The 17 Principles of Conflict Resolution</h2><p><b>The seventeen key principles for transforming conflict&#x2014;in a beautiful package from the creator of <i>The 48 Laws of Power</i></b><br><br>From Joost Elffers, the packaging genius behind the huge <i>New York Times </i>bestsellers <i>The 48 Laws of Power</i>, <i>The 33 Strategies of War</i>, and <i>The Art of Seduction</i>, comes this invaluable manual that teaches seventeen fundamentals for turning any conflict into an opportunity for growth.

Pr.). His latest work is the first genuine biography of Pericles in English since A.R. Burn's Pericles and Athens (1949) and the most spirited defense of the Athenian democracy since W.G. Forrest's The Emergence of Greek Democracy (1966). The book is a lively and thoughtful chronicle of the years leading up to and into the great war between the Athenians and Spartans. Pericles is cast as the tragic hero whose flaw is the very rationality with which he so skillfully guided the Athenians and forged an empire. Contrary to the charges of both ancient and modern critics, Kagan argues that the democracy was a rational, deliberate, and moderate regime, and Pericles is portrayed as the consummate visionary political leader whose great mistake was to expect everyone to think and behave as rationally as he did. This learned and passionate book is sure to cause controversy and is recommended to both academic and public libraries.<br><i>- V.

As members of the outfit, they plotted the slaying of a fellow gangster, committed the bombing murder of a trucking executive, the gangland execution of two mobsters&#x2014;whose burial in an Indiana cornfield was reenacted in Martin Scorsese&#x2019;s blockbuster film Casino&#x2014;and numerous other hits. <br><br>The Calabrese Crew&#x2019;s colossal earnings and extreme ruthlessness made them both a dreaded criminal gang and the object of an intense FBi inquiry. When Frank Jr., his father, and Uncle Nick are convicted on racketeering violations, &#x201c;Junior&#x201d; and &#x201c;Senior&#x201d; are sent to the same federal penitentiary in Michigan. It's there that Frank Jr. makes the life-changing decision to go straight. But he needs to keep his father behind bars in order to regain control of his life and save his family. So Frank Jr. makes a secret deal with prosecutors, and for six months&#x2014;unmonitored and unprotected&#x2014;he wears a wire as his father recounts decades of hideous crimes. Frank Jr.&#x2019;s cooperation with the FBI for virtually no monetary gain or special privileges helped create the government&#x2019;s &#x201c;Operation Family Secrets&#x201d; campaign against the Chicago outfit, which reopened eighteen unsolved murders, implicated twelve La Cosa Nostra soldiers and two outfit bosses, and became one of the largest organized crime cases in U.S. history.<br><i><br>Operation Family Secrets</i> intimately portrays how organized crime rots a family from the inside out while detailing Frank Jr.&#x2019;s deadly prison-yard mission, the FBI&#x2019;s landmark investigation, and the U.S. attorney&#x2019;s office&#x2019;s daring prosecution of America&#x2019;s most dangerous criminal organization.</p><p>Frank Calabrese, Jr., lived in his native Chicago for thirty-nine years.

When floods or tornadoes devastate an area, or when shootings and violence shock a community, knowing what to do can be the difference between calm and chaos, courage and fear, life and death. But few churches plan in advance for what they should do&#x2015; until the storm hits. Don't get caught unprepared. If a natural disaster or human tragedy strikes your community, your church can minister to the hurting. Jamie Aten and David Boan, codirectors of the Humanitarian Disaster Institute, provide a practical guide for disaster preparedness. Disaster ministry is a critically important work of the church, preparing for the unthinkable, providing relief to survivors, caring for the vulnerable and helping communities recover. Filled with resources for emergency planning and crisis management, this book provides best practices for local congregations. By taking action in advance, your church can help prevent harm and save lives during a disaster. The time to plan is now. Be prepared.</p><p>Jamie D.

In <em>Disaster Ministry Handbook</em>, Aten and Boan provide practical procedures for establishing disaster ministries in your church, healing the hearts of those in distress as well as helping those in need. Every pastor should prepare to lead, even in the most difficult circumstances; to that end this book is vital." (Ed Stetzer, edstetzer.com)<br><br>"Since the devastating Great East Japan Earthquake and tsunami disaster, churches in Japan have been learning disaster ministry in a hard way. As the general secretary of Japan Evangelical Association, there were many times I wished that I had a guidebook for this kind of ministry. This handbook by Dr. Boan and Dr. Aten clearly outlines the scope and necessary components of disaster ministry in a comprehensive manner, which give us a big picture of what disaster ministry is all about. It also provides very practical tips and procedures that help us to put things in action and actually get things done in a real disaster situation. I have personally worked closely with Dr. Boan and Dr. Aten in our disaster response ministries in Japan and their research and insights have helped us a great deal. I would like to recommend this book for all who are involved in disaster ministry." (Kenichi Shinagawa, general secretary of Japan Evangelical Association)<br><br>"I got a first-hand taste of the excellent training and fresh approach that Drs. Jamie Aten and David Boan delivered in the disaster ministry workshop they ran in June 2013 at Wheaton College. Their holistic insight into risk reduction, community resilience and disaster preparedness is amazing, from dealing with small community emergencies to large-scale national emergencies. This launched a strong partnership between Wheaton Humanitarian Disaster Institute and Micah Network, where we have collaborated in our Asia Regional Consultation entitled Solidarity in Disaster Management. I was thrilled to see the collation of all this experience into an accessible and very important handbook for all engaged in disaster ministry. That should be all of us, as we never know when we will be called on to respond. It is better to be ready and to ensure that our communities are best prepared. This handbook should be in the hands of all of us who are committed to caring for our communities. Thanks for this important resource." (Sheryl Haw, international director, Micah Network)<br><br>"In my work on climate change and environmental problems, I've become acutely aware that disasters&#x2015;whether in the form of violent conflicts, spreading diseases or extreme weather events&#x2015;are only growing worse and more frequent. We know that when such disasters hit, people turn to churches and Christians for help. The question is, will we be faithful and ready? Thanks to Jamie Aten and David Boan, the answer can be a resounding yes. This highly practical book is an urgent and important resource for Christians and churches everywhere." (Ben Lowe, activist, national spokesperson, Young Evangelicals for Climate Action, author, Doing Good Without Giving Up)<br><br>"This handbook is a must-have tool for all churches and congregations. It gives step-by-step instructions on how to prepare for a disaster, what to do when a disaster hits and how the church and its congregation can establish care, comfort and support to those recovering from disasters. Ephesians 2:10 states 'For we are God's workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to do good works that he has prepared in advance for us to do.' I believe this handbook will be a blessing for you and your church in times of disasters." (Ron Willett, director, World Renew Disaster Response Services)<br><br>"The authors are to be commended for producing an excellent handbook that is a prerequisite for Christian communities wanting to respond to the vulnerable in disasters. Based on thorough research and practical experience, the authors show us that sympathy and goodwill are not enough to ensure a disaster response will be truly compassionate, hold up to ethical and financial scrutiny, or be effective. Sympathy, good will, especially infused with godly spirituality, are necessary, but so also are thorough examination of motives and 'calling,' planning and training. This work excels in bringing all of these together to provide a treasure chest of guidance and tools that will assist churches and groups to assess both their skills and limitations for disaster response, and to plan thoroughly and train effectively. The vulnerable of their own faith communities and the civic communities they seek to serve will be all the richer for the kind of insights and practical directions this work so helpfully provides."

Jamie Aten and David Boan provide an essential, preparatory wake-up call to the church in the <em>Disaster Ministry Handbook</em>. The research is clear&#x2015;the church has not provided the right kind of assistance to older and disabled members and their caregivers before, during and after catastrophic events. Having led faith-based, post-Katrina and F4 tornado initiatives, I can say with confidence that lives will be saved when the guidelines of this critical book are implemented by churches and taught in seminaries." (Dr. Michael Parker, professor, University of Alabama, Center for Mental Health Aging, associate professor, UAB Comprehensive Center for Aging)<br><br>"In this book, Drs. Jamie Aten and David Boan prepare local churches for ministering to communities impacted by disasters. Drawing on personal stories and examples from their work around the globe, they show how churches can address both the spiritual and practical needs of disaster survivors. They offer guidance on how the church can be a vehicle for justice at what are often unjust times." (The Rev. Canon Leslie J.

Colour theory is included. It uses widely available colours. When you need spot-on, repeatable colours, you'll find this book essential. It's easy to use with very clear instructions * Karen Platt- yarnsandfabrics.co.uk * January 2016 Julie Collins' handy pocket sized guide to mixing acrylic colours contains 48 pages packed full of advice on mixing acrylic colours for all possible uses. There's information on colour theory, complementary colours, warm and cool colours, colour tone, using a limited palette, dull and bright colours and using local colour. Julie uses readily available Winsor &amp; Newton colours and presents the information in a clear practical way. A colour wheel and template are included so that readers can paint their own colour wheel. * The Leisure Painter * December 2016 Julie Collins' previous book on colour mixing with watercolours was reviewed in our December 2015 issue. The latest book on Acrylics is a good addition to the series. It follows the same structure as the Watercolours book, using a limited palette (this time thirteen colours plus white) from primary and secondary colours but as a different medium, producing different colours and results. The book explores the colour wheel, tone and dulling colours before moving onto the colour mixing catalogue. This book is a handy reference tool for planning a colour scheme and would be useful for creating a many layered piece for mixed media work. Julie Collins makes the point at the beginning that you need to spend time mixing your colours in order to make the right choices for a piece of work. She likens it to an athlete warming up before a race rather than rushing into a 100m sprint. It's a great metaphor to consider when approaching colour. * Workshop on the Web *</p><h2>Ascend: A Trylle Novel (A Trylle Novel, 3)</h2><p><p><i>Amanda Hocking is an indie publishing sensation whose self-published novels have sold millions of copies all over the world.

In the two decades before the First World War, the country experienced exceptional rates of industrial growth, outpacing those of the United States, Germany, and Great Britain. Under Minister of Finance Sergei Witte massive domestic and foreign investment was made in Russian industry, mining, and railroads. Between 1850 and 1905, Russia went from 850 miles of railroads to nearly 40,000. The oil industry grew to match that of the United States, and Russia surpassed France in steel production. In the early 1880s, St. Petersburg and Moscow were connected by the longest telephone line in the world. The first cinemas appeared in Russia in 1903, the same year the number of electric streetlights in St. Petersburg reached three thousand. By 1914, Russia had become the fifth-largest industrial power in the world.1 The pace and future promise of economic growth and power made the other powers view Russia with a combination of wonder, envy, and fear.2</p> <p>Yet despite rapid industrialization, the explosive growth of Russia's urban centers, and unprecedented foreign investment, Russia in 1900 was still a feudal society. Its social makeup resembled a pyramid with a large base extending gradually to a narrow tip. At the bottom was the great mass of peasants, 80 percent of the entire population. At the top was the emperor, the autocratic ruler of a vast, multiethnic empire of almost 130 million people in 1897. In between lay several social groups defined by laws and customs that went back hundreds of years: the clergy, the townsmen, the so-called distinguished or honored citizens, the merchants, and the nobility.3 Unlike Western Europe or the United States, there was no large urban middle class or bourgeoisie. In the late 1890s, just over 13 percent of the population lived in cities, compared with 72 percent in England, 47 in Germany, and 38 in the United States. Russia's cities were home to the vast majority of the country's small educated elite, while in the rural areas less than a quarter of the population was literate.4</p> <p>Not only was Russia still a traditional peasant society, but it remained politically mired in the past. Russia was ruled not by laws or institutions but by one man, the emperor. According to the Fundamental Laws of 1832, "The Russian Empire is ruled on the firm basis of positive laws and statutes which emanate from the Autocratic Power." The Russian emperor's power was understood as unlimited; imperial decrees, as well as verbal instructions and commands, had the force of law. This is not to say there were no laws or no sense of legality, rather, that the emperor had the freedom and power to decide whether he cared to recognize them.5</p> <p>By the latter decades of the nineteenth century Russia's educated classes were growing increasingly concerned by the dichotomy of a modernizing society and an old-fashioned and rigid political system. While the country was moving into the modern era, the state seemed impervious to change. Tsar Alexander II had of course taken steps to modernize Russia during the era of the Great Reforms. In 1861, the serfs were freed, ending a horrific system of human bondage stretching back hundreds of years that, by the eighteenth century, had descended to a level of inhumanity akin to American slavery.6 In 1864, the legal system was reformed to create an independent judiciary in which all Russians, except peasants, the vast majority of the population, were to be equal before the law. The same year local society was granted greater authority over managing its affairs, chiefly in the areas of public education, health, and roadways, with the creation of zemstvos, elected institutions of local self-government separate from the central government. The "tsar-liberator" had approved a plan to consult with a small number of representatives of society to consider further reforms (the so-called Loris-Melikov Constitution) when he was blown up by a bomb thrown by members of the terrorist organization The People's Will on March 1, 1881.</p> <p>Upon coming to the throne, Alexander III tore up the Loris-Melikov Constitution and issued an imperial manifesto reasserting undiluted and absolute autocratic power. Minister of the Interior Count Dmitry Tolstoy baldly stated the new program of the government with a single word, "Order."7 Counterreforms were instituted to undo or limit the reforms of the 1860s. In the summer of 1881, the government issued new Temporary Regulations intended to keep the peace and protect public order. The regulations invested the government with ever-greater power to monitor, arrest, and exile its subjects without recourse. Houses could be searched; businesses and schools closed; any sort of gathering, whether public or private, prohibited. The regulations even gave the government power to deny town councils and zemstvos the right to meet and to dismiss from such bodies anyone considered politically unreliable. Intended to last only three years, the Temporary Regulations were repeatedly renewed by Alexander III and later by Nicholas II, creating a state of near-martial law.8</p> <p>Alexander III brought renewed repression, but little else. If some could see in Alexander the revived spirit of Peter the Great with his cudgel, others just saw the cudgel.9 He had no need of society, even its most conservative, pro-autocratic members. In March 1881, a group of aristocratic conservatives founded the Holy Company to safeguard the life of the new tsar and take the fight to the revolutionaries. When its members, who included Count Sergei Sheremetev, dared suggest that repressive measures alone might not be enough to defeat the regime's enemies and some sort of changes to the government ought to be considered, the emperor's ministers denounced the Holy Company and forced it to disband. According to Minister Dmitry Tolstoy, the Holy Company was infected with "noxious liberalism."10</p> <p>Alexander III's son and heir Nicholas was at Livadia, in the Crimea, when, in October 1894, he got the news that his father was dead. According to Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich, his brother-in-law, a stunned Nicholas took him by the arm and said, "What am I going to do, what is going to happen to me, to you, [...] to mother, to all of Russia? I am not prepared to be a Czar. I never wanted to become one. I know nothing of the business of ruling." The grand duke, and history, would confirm the truth of Nicholas's words. Alexander Mikhailovich wrote that Nicholas's personal qualities, while "praiseworthy in a simple citizen," were "fatal in a Czar."11 Weak, indecisive, overwhelmed by the responsibilities of rule, and mindlessly beholden to "fate," Nicholas did prove to be fatal to himself, fatal to his family, and fatal to Russia.</p> <p>From the start of his reign, Nicholas pledged to continue to rule in the spirit of his late father. Nicholas maintained tight censorship of the press, furthered the policy of limiting the power of the zemstvos, restricted the autonomy of Russia's universities, and renewed the Temporary Regulations. When, in January 1895, a delegation of zemstvo representatives wished him a long and successful reign and dared mention their desire to play a role in communicating to the government the wishes of the people, Nicholas stopped them by calling their desire a "senseless dream." "Let all know," he told them, "that in devoting all my strength to the people's well-being, I shall safeguard the principles of autocracy as firmly and as unswervingly as did my late, unforgettable father."12</p> <p>But he could not, and he did not. Where the father had known what he wanted, the son was never sure; where the father had been resolute, the son had trouble making and sticking to a decision. Intent on showing that his hand was firmly on the rudder of state, Nicholas insisted on overseeing nearly every decision that attended administering a great empire. It did not take long for the ill-equipped emperor to become overwhelmed and then paralyzed by indecision. When confronted with difficult problems, Nicholas was apt to go pale, light a cigarette, and fall silent.13 Society wits quipped that "Russia did not need a constitution to limit the monarchy since she already had a limited monarch." Confusion, incoherence, stasis, and a sense of aimless drift began to emanate from the office of the emperor and infect the government.14</p> <p>Nonetheless, there was one aspect of Russian political culture that survived the reign of Alexander III. The Russians call it proizv�l, a word that lacks any clear English equivalent but is most often translated as "arbitrary rule." Proizvol was evident in the workings of the Okhrana, the secret police, an organization that was charged with combating terrorists but that seemed to suspect everyone, even the emperor's loyal subjects, of subversion. Proizvol was evident in the sweeping authority of the provincial governors, who often ruled over vast regions of the empire as venal satraps. The educated classes, particularly the men in the zemstvos whose work the governors obstructed and whose authority they tried to thwart, resented their power the most. The state's interference in the zemstvos proved to have far-reaching consequences: by 1900, the zemstvos were dominated by the nobility, and in cracking down on them, the government turned its most important ally into an opponent.15</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>At the end of the nineteenth century, the nobility comprised almost 1.9 million people, about 1.5 percent of the entire population of the Russian Empire. The nobility was a diverse group, divided by nationality (Russians, Poles, Georgians, Baltic Germans), religion (Russian Orthodoxy, Catholicism, Lutheranism), education and wealth (from a great deal of both to little of either), and political outlook (from reactionaries to revolutionaries). There were hereditary nobles, whose privileged status passed to their offspring, and personal nobles, whose did not. So great was the diversity among the empire's nobility that historians continue to debate whether it even deserves to be considered a distinct social class.16 If there was one thing that defined a noble, it was, as a commentator wrote in "The Tasks of the Nobility" in 1895, a certain quality "of being among the chosen, of being privileged, of not being the same as all other people."17 The Russian nobility was never, however, a class of idle rich. Rather, it had always been a service class that initially derived its privileges and then increasingly its own identity from serving the grand princes of Muscovy and later the tsars of imperial Russia whether at court, in the military, or in the administration.</p> <p>At the top of the nobility was the aristocratic elite, roughly a hundred or so families with great landed wealth dating back to at least the eighteenth century. These nobles often held high positions at court or in the government.18 The aristocracy was typically old, titled, and rich. It intermarried and had a sense of itself as a self-defined group. Aristocrats belonged to the same clubs and salons, and the young men served in the elite imperial guards regiments like the Chevaliers Gardes, the Horse Guard, and the Emperor's Life Guard Hussars. Part of the aristocracy (including the Golitsyns, Gagarins, Dolgorukys, and Volkonskys) descended from the ancient princely dynasties of Riurik and Gedymin; others came from nontitled boyar families of the Muscovite court, most notably the Naryshkins and the Sheremetevs, a branch of which acquired the title of count under Peter the Great; or from other old noble families that had served in the cavalry units, such as the Shuvalovs, Vorontsovs, and Orlovs.19</p> <p>Princess Sophy Dolgoruky, born into the aristocracy in the final decade of the tsarist empire, recalled how "[i]n the old days any lesser mortal who had not been born into the privileged caste was considered not 'born.' 'Elle n'est pas n�e' was a phrase to which my youthful ears were quite accustomed, if my grandmother referred to one who had married into the select club of European aristocracy, but was unable to claim a title in her own right." (Nevertheless, as Sophy points out in her memoir, Grandmother chose to remain silent about the fact that her great-grandmother had been bought at a slave market in Constantinople by an Austrian prince and then handed over to the Polish count Potocki as the winnings in a card game.) While the members of this tiny elite held different interests and attitudes, they all, according to Sophy, prized education, possessed unimaginable wealth (though this was never mentioned, for to do so showed an utter lack of breeding), and lived in "a luxury that was a natural part of existence."</p> <p>So, for instance, sheets and pillow-cases were changed daily. All were of very fine cool linen with the personal initial and crown (to indicate the title) embroidered on every item. Underclothes naturally would never be worn twice and towels were changed immediately after use. The tablecloths covering the long tables and the napkins intricately folded at each place would have the family coat of arms actually woven into the centre. Obviously each big house had its own laundry on the premises, together with a plethora of servants who, with their families, lived, feudal fashion, in two sides of the house round the courtyard, above the stables and garages. Thinking back to the Dolgorouky household it [sic] seems incredible that such a number of people were needed to care for the physical comfort of one family.</p> <p>In the large marble-floored front hall sat the svetzar whose only duty was to open the door and lay down the strip of red carpet to car or carriage, so that the shoes of those arriving or departing should not be sullied by contact with the pavement. To keep him company in the hall were the couple of liveried footmen on duty that day--or when my uncle was in residence--a couple of Cossacks in full uniform.20</p> <p>Below the aristocracy lay the great mass of nobles who filled the ranks of the officer corps and the civil administration or had gone into the so-called free professions as lawyers, doctors, teachers, or scientists. About half of all urban nobles were either in state service or in these professions around the turn of the century; the next largest category was rentiers.21 The nobility had traditionally been the landowning class, and this remained true right up to 1917. Until the emancipation in 1861, the nobility had for centuries lived off the labor of millions of serfs, labor that made some nobles fabulously rich. If there is one image of the prerevolutionary landed nobility that has stuck in the popular imagination, it is that of the Ranevskys in Anton Chekhov's The Cherry Orchard. Impecunious, trapped by tradition, doomed to oblivion by the forces of modernity, Lyubov Ranevskaya cannot bring herself to cut down the orchard and rent out the land for summer vacationers ("Summer cottages, summer residents--I'm sorry, it's all too vulgar," she says with a sigh) and loses her estate and everything she holds dear.22</p> <p>It is tempting to take Chekhov's play for sociology and to see in the story of the Ranevskys the plight of the entire Russian nobility, an ancient class inescapably shuffling toward extinction. But the reality was never quite so bleak. The lower rungs of the rural nobility were indeed becoming more impoverished, and many were forced to sell their lands; between 1861 and 1905, the rural nobility lost an average of 1 percent of its land a year through either sale or foreclosure. Nonetheless, as late as 1915, the nobility still ...</p></p><h2>Owsley and Me: My LSD Family</h2><p><p><i>Owsley and Me</i> is a love story set against the background of the Psychedelic Revolution of the '60s.

He was the first person to mass manufacture LSD and is reputed to have produced more than 1.25 million doses between the years 1965 to 1967. In 1965 Owsley became the key supplier of LSD to Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters. He was later featured in Tom Wolfe&#x2019;s The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test. He also provided LSD to the Beatles during the filming of Magical Mystery Tour.<br>In 1966 during the Acid tests Owsley met the members of the Grateful Dead. He became their first soundman as well as financier. Along with his close friend Bob Thomas, he designed the Lightning Bolt Skull Logo often referred to by fans as the&#x2019; Steal Your Face&#x2019; which predated the album of the same name by 8 years. Stanley began a long- term practice of recording the Dead while they rehearsed and performed. Stanley also made numerous live recordings of other leading 1960s and 1970s artists appearing in San Francisco, including Quicksilver Messenger Service, Jefferson Airplane, early Jefferson Starship, Janis Joplin, Big Brother and the Holding Company, Taj Mahal, Santana, Miles Davis, Jimi Hendrix, Johnny Cash, Blue Cheer (a band that took its name from the nickname of Stanley's LSD), and many others. While many Owsley recordings have been released, many more remain unissued.<br>Owsley was born (1935) into a prominent political family from Kentucky. His father was a government attorney. His grandfather, A. Owsley Stanley, a member of the United States Senate after serving as Governor of Kentucky and in the U.S. House of Representatives, campaigned against alcohol Prohibition. Owsley studied engineering at the University of Virginia before dropping out in 1956.He enlisted in the U.S. Air Force and served for eighteen months before being discharged in 1958. Later, inspired by a 1958 performance of the Bolshoi Ballet, he began studying ballet in Los Angeles, supporting himself for a time as a professional dancer. In 1963, he enrolled at the University of California, Berkeley where he became involved in the psychoactive drug scene. He dropped out after a semester, took a technical job at KGO-TV, and began producing LSD in a small lab located in the bathroom of a house near campus. His makeshift laboratory was raided by police on February 21, 1965. He beat the charges and successfully sued for the return of his equipment. The police were looking for methamphetamine but found only LSD, which was not illegal at the time.<br>In 1970, 19 members of the Grateful Dead and crew were busted at a French Quarter hotel after returning from a concert at "The Warehouse" in New Orleans, Louisiana for a combination of drugs..

I would share my LSD. I loved getting high. I was good at it. I had my freak-out early in the game, but after more than a hundred acid trips, my familiarization changed the experience. I still had hallucinatory visuals, but my free-associative inner thoughts were now the place of transformation. My self got high.<br><br>In 1969, on the night of June 7, I gyrated on the dance floor under the strobe light, losing my self in the rhythm section of the Grateful Dead. Then Janis Joplin came on stage and joined Pigpen for Turn On Your Love Light.&#x201d;<br><br> Turn on your love light,&#x201d; I screamed, inaudible in the ocean of amplified music. Onstage Pigpen and Janis reveled in the lyrics and each other. On the floor, everyone danced with abandon. Bear appeared and gravitated to me. We moved in circles around each other, faster and faster.<br><br>The song ended, the house lights came on, and hundreds of stoned hippies looked<br>for each other. We went backstage where Janis was sprawled on a velvet upholstered chair with her legs over the arm rest. The three-gallon stainless steel punch bowl on the table was empty. Wow, I thought. Bear had spiked the Kool-Aid with LSD and it was all gone. No wonder everyone was so stoned.<br><br>Janis sprang up from the chair, shook out her bell-bottoms, and angrily approached Bear. Man,&#x201d; she roared, What the fuck did you put in that Kool-Aid?&#x201d; She pointed her finger at Bear&#x2019;s face, her voice hoarse from singing. Her bracelets jangled. My saxophone player is in the hospital. Your fucking Kool-Aid freaked him out. Man, you know these cats are studio musicians. They don&#x2019;t know from your fuckin&#x2019; psychedelic scene.&#x201d;<br><br>Bear was suddenly sober to make sense of this onslaught. I put the usual in the Kool-Aid. If your sax man can&#x2019;t handle a little pure LSD, he might not be up to your standard.&#x201d; Bear was still pissed at Janis for leaving Big Brother. He was convinced that Big Brother had been a better band.<br><br>Janis was insulted. He&#x2019;s a great sax man, and now he&#x2019;s in the hospital overdosed on your fuckin&#x2019; LSD.&#x201d;<br><br> What did he do drink half the bowl?&#x201d; Bear twittered provocatively.<br><br>Janis and Bear argued two confrontational Capricorns who shared a January<br>19th birthday. Bear explained with his usual dose, 270 micrograms, drinking a glassful, as most people did, was ideal. Still, how much Kool-Aid is in a punchbowl? Bear would have put his aluminum briefcase down on the table with assorted cookies, paper cups, and the punchbowl. Opening his bountiful man-purse, he would have pulled out a glycine paper bindle of crystalline LSD and added a measure to the punchbowl like a chef adding stock to the soup du jour. As he had on other occasions, he might have stirred the liquid with his finger, then put it in his mouth, testing the taste for the slightly acerbic presence<br>of lysergic acid.<br><br> With more than a cup, you&#x2019;d have a sugar meltdown. The insulin release is<br>worse on your system,&#x201d; Bear declared. The dose in a glass of punch is too small to send your sax man to the hospital. Something else must have happened.&#x201d;<br><br> A lot of people got too stoned,&#x201d; someone joined in. Bear questioned a few prominent entities backstage and found that Goldfinger had been there before the show. He must have spiked the Kool-Aid too. What an asshole. He didn&#x2019;t even check with me.&#x201d;<br><br>Owsley was furious but continued to methodically pack up the equipment. When we were ready to leave, no one was left in the ballroom except Bill Graham standing on the stairway with his arms crossed. Owsley was vexed but silent as we slid past and out the door. The night air was cold and clear. The stars were out and beckoning. The music was still playing in my head. My feet barely touched the ground.<br><br> Let&#x2019;s go to OJ&#x2019;s for a steak.&#x201d;<br><br> Good,&#x201d; I answered. I&#x2019;m hungry, too.&#x201d;<br><br>The street was deserted. Then I heard a moan, a guttural utterance as if an animal were in distress. At first I thought I was hallucinating, but then I heard it again. It seemed to come from below. I saw a naked human form, flesh and hair lying in the gutter. I bent closer and recognized Robert Hunter&#x2019;s face. He was dirty, distressed, muttering to himself. When Bear walked up, Hunter jumped to his feet.<br><br> Owsleystein!&#x201d; He grabbed Bear in a headlock.<br><br> Hunter,&#x201d; I cried, What are you doing? That&#x2019;s Bear.&#x201d;<br><br>He acted like he couldn&#x2019;t hear me and responded, I will annihilate you, Owsleystein!&#x201d;<br><br>Bear was trying not to struggle with his freaked-out friend.<br><br> The monster you created destroyeth you.&#x201d; Hunter was bulky and strong, and I pulled at his arm around Bear&#x2019;s neck, and suddenly he fell to the ground. His eyes were wide and so dilated I couldn&#x2019;t see their color. Bear got away and quietly walked in the direction of the car. I stood by the stricken poet.<br><br> No, Bear, we can&#x2019;t leave Hunter like this.&#x201d;<br><br>Bear stopped in his tracks and stared at the sidewalk, his hands clenched at his<br>sides. Fuck it! Now we can&#x2019;t go to Original Joe's. Let&#x2019;s take Hunter to Goldfinger&#x2019;s house. I&#x2019;ll get the car.&#x201d;<br><br>Hunter was speaking in his deep voice of dire predictions, dreaded consequences,<br>crackups, and wrecks. He was in a time warp, an alternate reality on Market Street. Hunter thought I was sharing his vision, but I had no idea what planet he was on. I knew enough not to drink from an open punch bowl. My own supply had given me the choice of how high I wanted to get. To me Hunter looked like a prehistoric man, a Neanderthal,as he lay down once more in the gutter on Market Street. I couldn&#x2019;t help staring at his penis.<br><br> Hunter,&#x201d; I asked, Where are your clothes?&#x201d;<br><br>He pointed. About thirty feet further up the street were his jeans, white briefs, socks, and boots. Here was the poet who translated Rilke&#x2019;s poetry, the intellectual who embraced the philosophy of Edmund Husserl, believing that perception alters fact. Boy, was he dusted. I offered him his jeans. Put on your clothes!&#x201d;He accepted the pants, then threw them into the street. Don&#x2019;t tell me what to do. You are not my mother.&#x201d;<br><br>He was right. I was being judgmental and critical at a time when love was needed. I had fallen back into old behavior patterns from my own fucked-up mother. I had not transformed. Oy vey iz mir.<br><br>Bear pulled up in the car. I opened the door to the back seat. Hunter, come on.<br>Get in.&#x201d;<br><br>Hunter looked at me without recognition. Bear helped me get Hunter on his feet<br>but he resisted, pointing his finger at Bear, howling, Owsleystein.&#x201d;<br><br> Hunter does not want to come with us. Let&#x2019;s go.&#x201d;<br><br> No, Bear. We can&#x2019;t leave him here.&#x201d; I stood before the caveman and looked into<br>his eyes. Hunter, it&#x2019;s Rhoney, Rhoney. See, me.&#x201d; I took his hand and tapped it on my head. You can&#x2019;t stay on the street. It&#x2019;s late. The gig is over. Everyone&#x2019;s gone.&#x201d;<br><br>His face became the mask of tragedy. She&#x2019;s gone,&#x201d; he moaned, tears welling.<br> Hunter, what&#x2019;s the matter? Is it Christie you&#x2019;ve lost?&#x201d; He shook his head yes. He and his gorgeous girlfriend were inseparable. Where was she?<br><br> Don&#x2019;t worry. We&#x2019;ll find her. Come with us now. Hunter, please,&#x201d; I pleaded. Get<br>into the car. We&#x2019;ll look for Christie. I promise. Everything will be okay. Come on, baby. Come on baby, do the locomotion.&#x2019;&#x201d; I sung to him in my raspy voice and wiggled my butt like a choo-choo train. My voice soothed him enough to get him into the backseat.<br><br>Bear drove in his haphazard fashion through a maze of back streets until we<br>pulled up in front of Goldfinger&#x2019;s Victorian flat on Nob Hill. Hunter was crouched down and quiet, but when the engine stopped he wailed, She always will be in the shadow of my heart. Where, where did she go?&#x201d;<br><br> Hunter, it&#x2019;s okay. We&#x2019;ll find her.&#x201d;<br><br> Hunter&#x2019;s a Cancer. He can&#x2019;t help worrying about his home and family,&#x201d; observed<br>Bear. Let&#x2019;s dump him on Goldfinger.&#x201d;<br><br>Hunter was a big guy and it was a struggle to get him halfway up the long<br>stairway to Goldfinger&#x2019;s front door. I held up Hunter as Bear scrambled to the top and returned with Goldfinger&#x2019;s girl, Nicki. Goldfinger wasn&#x2019;t there, but Nicki was cool. The three of us guided Hunter up the remaining climb, his deep voice calling out, Gone,&#x201d; as we made it inside.<br><br>Nicki said, She could be at Garcia&#x2019;s. I&#x2019;ll call out there.&#x201d;<br><br>Hunter sat on the sofa by the bay window looking out at the Golden Gate Bridge.<br>He shook his head. No, no!&#x201d;<br><br>Nicki frisked her long brown hair off her face as she sat before the heavy black<br>telephone on the table. She concentrated on the matter at hand. The babysitter answered. No, Mountain Girl and Garcia were not home.<br><br> Someone at the Airplane House will know where he is.&#x201d; Bear sat next to Nicki<br>and commandeered the phone, but no Goldfinger.<br><br>Hunter pointed at Bear. Owsleystein!&#x201d; Then his arm fell back and he stared at<br>the Persian carpet.<br><br> I think he&#x2019;s better,&#x201d; Owsley said.<br><br> Hunter,&#x201d; I asked, Would you like some water?&#x201d;<br><br>No answer. I went into the kitchen and brought back a glass of water. I handed<br>Hunter the heavy, ornate glass. He eyed it suspiciously and gave it back. Nicki propped a pillow behind him, and he slumped on the couch. She joined me at the table. Bear rummaged through the refrigerator, looking for food, ruminating on his options, Rabbit food. Nothing but rabbit food.&#x201d; He turned to us. Where is Goldfinger? I hope he just put acid in that Kool-Aid. But with Goldfinger, you never know.&#x201d; Bear chuckled.<br><br>I realized I was getting hungry, too. I found bread, cereal, milk, and bananas.<br>Comfort food was just fine with me.<br><br> Carbs, nothing but carbs,&#x201d; Bear commented. There&#x2019;s nothing to eat.&#x201d;<br><br>I contradicted him. There&#x2019;s a jar of peanut butter.&#x201d;<br><br> Where?&#x201d;<br><br> The second shelf on the door.&#x201d;<br><br>Just then Hunter walked in and ranted about the way reality looked to him, Only<br>perception gives an object dimension, that the mind creates. I am not your creation. I am not your trip. I control my presentation in time. You only control your perception of me.&#x201d;<br><br>I was still very high myself. I was in that clear mental state when the mind feels like a planet-sized chamber. Hunter,&#x201d; I asked, engaging his thought processes, is it the viewer&#x2019;s perception of consciousness, not consciousness itself, which is critical?&#x201d;<br><br>Suddenly Hunter looked happy.<br><br> It is not the object but the perception of the object. There are distinctions and there are connections.&#x201d; I felt as if I finally had done something to help. I smiled too. But just as quickly, Hunter returned to the darkness; his words became incoherent. He dropped to the couch, put his hands over his mouth, and became lachrymose.<br><br>Nicki suggested taking Hunter to the hospital, but Bear and I knew that was a bad idea. In hospitals, they put freak-outs on Thorazine.<br><br> Thorazine is the wrong way to go,&#x201d; Bear said, but niacinamide it sometimes<br>works. I&#x2019;ve got some here, I think.&#x201d;<br><br>Niacinamide is a B vitamin that has antianxiety effects. In 1956, Abram Hoffer,<br>one of Bear&#x2019;s heroes, a Canadian biochemist and MD, had successfully reversed all LSD symptoms by intravenously injecting one gram of niacinamide into subjects high on LSD; however, the government quashed LSD research before the start of clinical trials. Bear went to his aluminum briefcase and produced a bottle of 1,000-microgram pills.<br><br> Works better if injected, but . . .&#x201d; Bear counted out ten.<br><br>Hunter was so weak, I helped him put the pills in his mouth, but</p><h2>The Way of Wyrd</h2><p>This is an authentic and deeply compelling insight into the spiritual world of the Anglo-Saxons.

Each succinct yet insightful entry is written by a leading authority on the opera and includes a full synopsis of the plot, a cast list, a note on the singers in the original production, and information on the origins of the work and its literary and social background. Contributions conclude with a brief comment on the particular work's place in operatic history. A glossary offers brief and accessible definitions of terms that may be unfamiliar to the reader. And indices of role names and of arias and ensembles allow the reader to find operas containing their favorite aria or a well-known character. <br><br>The second edition brings the book up to date with several recently composed operas and a fascinating introductory essay by David Levin on opera performance in the 21st century. Recent additions to the operatic repertory included for the first time in this edition include Nicholas Maw, <em>Sophie's</em> <em>Choice</em>; Poul Ruders, <em>A Handmaid's Tale</em>; John Adams, <em>Death of Klinghoffer</em>; and Mark Adamo, <em>Little Women</em>.<br><br>Covering all operas in the current repertory along with some less-well-known early and very modern ones, this is an ideal volume for the general opera lover.<br></p><p>The cover blurb calls <i>The New Grove Book of Operas</i>, "The world's definitive single volume of opera reference," and for once the hype is right on the money. The plot synopses are well done, with musical notes and historic background, some nice illustrations, and three very useful appendices: a fine and complete glossary; an index of role names; and an "Index of Incipits," or first lines, for hundreds of arias, choruses, and ensembles. This may well be the best English-language opera reference available.The late Stanley Sadie is one of the world's leading musicologists.

Michael P. Reiman, who is internationally respected for his teaching, clinical practice, and research focused on orthopedic assessment and treatment methods, presents an evidence-based guide on the examination process for various parts of the body. </p><p> The text takes a structured approach, moving from broad to focused, that guides clinicians in examining each client and condition. The text presents specific components of the examination in the same sequence, ensuring repetition and improved consistency in learning. Screenings are used early in the examination sequence not only to determine the appropriateness of performing an orthopedic examination but also to rule out other potential pain generators and thereby narrow the focus of the examination. </p><p><i>Orthopedic Clinical Examination</i> emphasizes evidence-based practice and therefore focuses on tests that are clinically relevant, providing students and clinicians with the most appropriate testing options rather than listing tests with no regard for their clinical value. Both treatment-based and pathological-based diagnostic styles are covered in detail so that readers will gain a thorough understanding of both approaches and be able to implement them separately or in tandem. In addition to musculoskeletal testing, the text provides information on including subjective history, observation, diagnostic imaging, systems and neurological screening, and performance-based measures in each examination. </p><p> The text is organized into five parts and is structured such that readers will first acquire requisite knowledge about anatomy and the examination process before advancing to acquiring specific examination skills. Part I presents information about the musculoskeletal and nervous systems as well as tissue behavior and healing. Part II introduces the principles of the examination sequence. Parts III and IV present the region-specific examination sequence for evaluating clients, including specifics on analyzing the head, spine, and extremities. Each chapter in these two parts covers the anatomy of the region, various types of injuries that occur, specific tests and measures that can be used, and cross-references to specific case studies for further review. Part V highlights additional considerations that may be necessary for special populations during the examination process. </p><p><i>Orthopedic Clinical Examination</i> includes learning tools that enhance comprehension and engagement: </p><p> � Full-color photographs and illustrations demonstrate anatomy, patient conditions, and clinician positioning to serve as a visual reference and ensure proper testing techniques. </p><p> � A library of 50 videos, found in the web resource, provides students with visual demonstrations of assessments and treatments. </p><p> � Color-coding graphics throughout chapters help readers quickly discern whether evidence supporting the reported finding is ideal, good, or less than good. </p><p> � Overviews of common orthopedic conditions for each body region are in the 12 applied chapters. </p><p> � Twenty-four case studies guide users in the proper questions to ask and steps to take in conducting examinations. </p><p> � Linkss to abstracts of articles provide additional clinical learning scenarios. </p><p> With <i>Orthopedic Clinical Examination</i>, current and future clinicians will gain the knowledge and confidence they need in performing examinations to provide optimal patient care. </p></p><p><p><b>Michael P.

According to the federal government, she and others from the Middle East are white. Indeed, a historical myth circulates even in immigrant families like Roya's, proclaiming Iranians to be the "original" white race. But based on the treatment Roya and her family receive in American schools, airports, workplaces, and neighborhoods&#x2014;interactions characterized by intolerance or hate&#x2014;Roya is increasingly certain that she is not white. In <i>The Limits of Whiteness</i>, Neda Maghbouleh offers a groundbreaking, timely look at how Iranians and other Middle Eastern Americans move across the color line. By shadowing Roya and more than 80 other young people, Maghbouleh documents Iranian Americans' shifting racial status. Drawing on never-before-analyzed historical and legal evidence, she captures the unique experience of an immigrant group trapped between legal racial invisibility and everyday racial hyper-visibility. Her findings are essential for understanding the unprecedented challenge Middle Easterners now face under "extreme vetting" and potential reclassification out of the "white" box. Maghbouleh tells for the first time the compelling, often heartbreaking story of how a white American immigrant group can become brown and what such a transformation says about race in America.</p><p><b>Neda Maghbouleh</b> is Assistant Professor of Sociology at the University of Toronto."Tremendously important for historians, sociologists, legal scholars and anthropologists, <i>The Limits of Whiteness</i> is required reading for those with interests in race, immigration, processes of othering, and diasporas." - <i>Canadian Journal of Sociology</i><br><br>"In this brilliantly designed, beautifully written, and persuasively argued book, Neda Maghbouleh demonstrates that Iranian-Americans inhabit a complex and contradictory relationship to race. Her evidence, ideas, and arguments make significant and lasting contributions to our understanding of whiteness as a social construction. The vivid and poignant portraits of the lives of second-generation Iranian Americans that form the evidentiary base of this brilliant book reveal whiteness to be a fickle and volatile category, an ever shifting entity shaped by political, cultural, linguistic, and religious practices that initially might seem to have little to do with race." - George Lipsitz, author of&nbsp;<i>The Possessive Investment in Whiteness</i><br><br>"I've been writing personal essays about Iranians and race for years, but Neda Maghbouleh's&nbsp;<i>The Limits of Whiteness</i>&nbsp;provides a much-needed sociologist's examination.

Beginning with the first wave of Mexican women crossing the border early in the century, historian Vicki L. Ruiz reveals the struggles they have faced and the communities they have built. In a narrative enhanced by interviews and personal stories, she shows how from labor camps, boxcar settlements, and urban barrios, Mexican women nurtured families, worked for wages, built extended networks, and participated in community associations--efforts that helped Mexican Americans find their own place in America. She also narrates the tensions that arose between generations, as the parents tried to rein in young daughters eager to adopt American ways. Finally, the book highlights the various forms of political protest initiated by Mexican-American women, including civil rights activity and protests against the war in Vietnam.<br><br>For this new edition of <em>From Out of the Shadows</em>, Ruiz has written an afterword that continues the story of the <em>Mexicana</em> experience in the United States, as well as outlines new additions to the growing field of Latina history.<br></p><p><br><strong>Vicki L.

Based primarily on the Concerns Based Adoption Model (CBAM), this user-friendly text focuses on introducing constructs that can be used by those engaged in creating, implementing, and sustaining change processes as well as those who are evaluating and studying change. Rather than maintaining a bird&#x2019;s eye view of change processes, each chapter introduces a research-based, research-verified construct about change that captures the complexity of implementing change and the diversity of reactions to it. With a stress on pedagogical aids, each chapter incorporates practical examples, sample research, case studies, reflection questions, and examples of common roadblocks to change.</p><p><b>Dr. Gene E.

Here they provide 100 family recipes, some more down-home than others. Brisket dumplings, for example, employ a Korean marinade and a dipping sauce with rice vinegar and pear juice, and their pork belly porchetta is stuffed with Italian sausage. But in an excellent chapter of pit-smoked meats, poetry and Americana run deep in dishes such as bourbon-buttered reverse-sear double-cut pork chops, and &#x201c;Meat Me in St. Louis&#x201d; ribs flavored with apple juice and a raspberry-chipotle sauce. Mason jars become parfait cups for a grits and collard parfait, as well as for a barbecue parfait that begins with layers of Fritos and baked beans and then is topped with whatever leftovers are at hand. The authors take porcine liberties in a chapter of libations that include a Salty Pig (ironically rimmed with kosher salt) and a Pork and Stormy, with bacon-washed bourbon and ginger beer.<br> &#x2014; <i><b>Publishers Weekly</b></i><br> &nbsp;</p><h2>A Gift from Abuela</h2><p><b>In her first book for children, Cecilia Ruiz illuminates how things can change &#x2014; and the importance of holding on to our dearest relationships when they do.</b><br><br>The first time Abuela holds Nina, her heart overflows with tenderness.

It's not like I sit around picturing him up on a cloud in a chaise lounge, fruity beverage in hand, waving down to me and saying, "Have fun down there!"</p> <p>But there have been moments of deep darkness-as I figured out the bills, health insurance, and child rearing alone-when I have wondered if he didn't get the better part of this deal.</p> <p>The first time I saw Bradley Tidd, I was in Colorado Springs where he was a cadet at the Air Force Academy. He was laughing as he threw a football, completely unaware of my stare. The grass in the field where everyone was tailgating was dry and crunchy, just begging for the first snow of the season. The grounds overflowed with sports cars, a purchase that seemed to be required of every cadet the moment they made it to their junior year.</p> <p>And in the middle of all of that macho testosterone stood Brad, his arm cocked above his shoulder, ready to throw a spiral to another classmate, laughing as if his internal joy couldn't be contained and was just bubbling out of him.</p> <p>A little shorter than I was, he had the all-American looks of a soon-to-be Air Force officer, with his light brown hair cut as close as it could be and his frame suggesting that he worked out but still had a good time. Four years my senior, he had a mischievous grin that reached all the way up to his green-hazel eyes and matched his irresistible laugh, which would eventually teach my heart how to stop and then keep right on going again.</p> <p>The last time I saw Bradley Tidd, thirteen years later, he lay motionless in a hospital bed not five miles away from that spot in the field. Those hazel eyes were shut, and the infectious laughter that had gotten us through moves, job changes, and childbirth had stopped. His hair was still short, now due to the battle he'd had with a receding hairline that started in his midtwenties and eventually won when, at thirty, he decided to start shaving his head completely bald.</p> <p>We were just so damn normal. He was the breadwinner; I was the homemaker. We grilled on the weekends with our neighbors, had occasional date nights where we tried our hardest to talk about anything other than the kids, loved a lot, and fought a little. There were times when I'd ask myself, "Is this it? What life is supposed to be like? Do I want more?" and almost always answered myself, "Nope. I'm good."</p> <p>We were partners in every way. And while our relationship wasn't perfect (whose is?), we seemed to function as well as we could, given the fact that we had three young children and almost no time to ourselves. Like most couples who have been together for a long time, I felt like I knew Brad better than anyone else in the world.</p> <p>And like most people who have been through an unimaginable loss, I've wondered, since he's been gone, if I knew myself at all.</p> <p>� � �</p> <p>July 16, 2007.</p> <p>Picture a normal Colorado summer morning, with blue skies and the perfect breeze floating through two open windows. At the crack of 8:30 a.m., I was still in my bed, half asleep, enjoying that gentle wind, waiting until the last minute to emerge from the cocoon I had created with the six pillows. I'm not the early riser.</p> <p>My kids figured out at a young age that, until their stomachs were audibly growling, they should not wake Mommy up. Even then, my oldest, Haley, who was five, would gently come in, rub my arm, and try to rouse the slumbering beast in the calmest way possible so as not to anger it. Sarah, who was eighteen months old at the time, must have gotten my sleeping gene, because she rarely woke up before 9:00 a.m. And my son, Michael, who was three and stuck in the middle of a bunch of estrogen, just tried to do whatever he could to blend into the background so that none of the crazy females surrounding him would strap him down, force a Cinderella costume on him, and take pictures to show future prom dates.</p> <p>He would pretty much go with the flow.</p> <p>As I slept with my pillow over my head (which I did every night because my dog snored like an Irishman on a bender), I slowly came out of my princess-like dream world, thinking, "Was that the phone ringing?"</p> <p>I checked my caller ID, which read "Penrose Hospital," with a Colorado Springs area code. I dismissed it, thinking that it was probably someone looking for a donation, and wasn't I lucky to avoid that call? I mean, that's why I had this, my favorite piece of technology. How did people avoid solicitors (and their extended family) in the '80s?</p> <p>But then I remembered that Brad was driving south of Denver that morning for work and that I'd better call back just in case.</p> <p>"Penrose Hospital."</p> <p>"Yes, I wanted to make sure that no one there called me. I just missed a call and I wanted to double-check that it wasn't about my husband."</p> <p>"Name?"</p> <p>"Brad Tidd."</p> <p>"Please hold."</p> <p>After holding for about five minutes, I felt my heart begin to pound in my ears. It should have taken that receptionist a minute to check her computer, see that he wasn't there, and get back on the phone with me, annoyed that I had wasted her time.</p> <p>"Ma'am?"</p> <p>"Yes?"</p> <p>"I'm transferring you to a nurse right now."</p> <p>Damn.</p> <p>A voice came on the line that was entirely too cheerful for the mood I was sinking into.</p> <p>"Hello? Mrs. Tidd? This is Joanie," she said over the noise of trauma in the background. "I have your husband here with me."</p> <p>"What happened?" I said frantically, running down the stairs from my second-floor bedroom and starting to pace. "What's going on? Is he okay? Why is he there?"</p> <p>"Now, don't worry. He's fine," she said in a way that I knew was supposed to calm me but just made me more impatient. "He's talking. He was in an accident, but you'll have to talk to someone when you get here about what happened. We're going to take him in for some x-rays and you can meet him in the ER. Right now it just looks like he has a dislocated knee. Don't rush. Take your time getting down here. I promise that he's okay."</p> <p>Right, lady. Don't rush. If he's so fine, why isn't he calling me?</p> <p>At that point I couldn't get off the phone fast enough. I couldn't trust some stranger to tell me that my husband was "fine." I needed to see for myself. I sat down on the recliner in the TV room for a minute and looked around wildly, trying to decide what to do next. Haley sat on the couch, her eyes focused on The Wiggles. Michael sat on the floor, fiercely concentrating on constructing a castle out of blocks. And I could hear the sounds of Sarah in her crib, babbling away to a stuffed animal.</p> <p>Crap. I can't take them with me. Now what?</p> <p>And I immediately started dialing my parents' phone number.</p> <p>My parents had moved to Denver six months earlier from Louisiana, something that I couldn't have been happier about. Those poor people had made it through Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, only to move north during one of the worst series of snowstorms on record in Colorado. Not only that, but they had brought along my extremely asthmatic ninety-five-year-old grandmother, who hadn't lived above sea level in fifty years.</p> <p>Those two had their hands full.</p> <p>I felt a little guilty about calling my mother that morning and adding something else to her plate, but before I had even finished saying the word "accident," she was walking out the door to come watch my kids.</p> <p>"I'm calling your dad. He'll meet you at the hospital," she said breathlessly.</p> <p>"Oh, Mom. Don't make Dad leave work. They said Brad was fine. I'll feel terrible if Dad has wasted the day," I said, knowing that my dad didn't miss work for anything.</p> <p>"He's coming." Click.</p> <p>While I waited the twenty agonizing minutes it took my mother to get to my house, I ran upstairs, took the quickest shower in history, and looked over the contents of my closet. What to wear? It was hot outside, but I knew that the temperature in hospitals could vary from muggy and hot to chilly and "I wish I had a sweatshirt" cold. I decided on layers and then packed a bag, thinking that if I was prepared for an overnight stay, it probably wouldn't happen. And in that bag I packed Brad's favorite shorts, T-shirt, and sneakers so that he would have something comfortable to wear on the ride home.</p> <p>My mother finally arrived, and I barely said hello to her before I threw everything into my minivan and screeched out of the driveway. I started driving south, mentally going through routes in my head to figure out the fastest way. Finally deciding to go through Castle Rock, I thought for sure I had missed rush-hour traffic and would be able to slide right onto the highway. And then I saw the signs and flashing lights just before the on-ramp.</p> <p>Construction.</p> <p>"You gotta be kidding me," I muttered. Looking around, trying to figure out if I could take a side street, I sat helplessly in my car, fidgeting in my seat until the traffic finally gave way to the wide-open highway.</p> <p>When I got down to the hospital in Colorado Springs and entered the trauma area, I was greeted by a woman who looked eerily like my cousin, adding to the surreal feeling of that moment. As I waited for forty-five minutes in the tiny, curtained room in the ER, I kept thinking to myself, "What in the world is JoAnn doing up here from Louisiana, and when did she become a nurse?"</p> <p>It's weird how the mind works during moments of extreme stress.</p> <p>After waiting what felt like hours for something to happen, everything seemed to happen at once. My dad walked into the room with a nervous expression on his face that I didn't want to see. And then a skinny little police officer with a mustache that looked like it had been a work in progress for twenty years came stomping in with an accusatory look.</p> <p>"Do you know what your husband did?" he demanded. "He passed a whole line of cars on his motorcycle on a two-lane road and hit a guy up ahead of him turning left."</p> <p>All of the moisture left my mouth. My hands began to shake, and I seemed to lose any sort of handle on how to speak.</p> <p>As if I wasn't shocked enough, he followed that with, "Wait until you see his helmet. You'll wonder how in the hell he survived this."</p> <p>At that moment, a couple of nurses wheeled Brad in. He was laid out on a gurney, neck stabilized, but looking pretty good for the most part. I mean, you T-bone another car when you're on a motorcycle going sixty miles an hour...I kind of expected him to look worse. Lucky for him, he had been wearing his helmet, with clothing covering every inch of his body. I think the "powers that be" knew that I'd have a hard time trying to nurse someone back to health who looked like something the road had chewed up and spit back out.</p> <p>Don't judge me...it's not that I'm really into looks. I'm just incredibly squeamish. I'm more of a PG girl, and most motorcycle accidents are on the R-rated side.</p> <p>"Now, he's got a pretty bad dislocated knee and some broken ribs," the nurse said. "He's going to be taking it easy for a while."</p> <p>"Brad. Brad!" The officer's voice suddenly came out in a staccato, as he tried to peer around the nurse who was untangling an IV. "Do you remember what happened?"</p> <p>Dazed and immobile, Brad tried to look up at him. "No."</p> <p>"You hit another car. You passed a whole group of cars going at a high rate of speed and hit a guy and knocked him out. You don't remember that?"</p> <p>"No?"</p> <p>Dissatisfied with Brad's inadequate answers, Captain Inappropriate marched out. And my husband's first words to me in the trauma room were, "Shit. We're going to get sued."</p> <p>I will say that one of my proudest moments as a wife was that I didn't just let him have it while he was lying there, voicing my concern over matters that, in the grand scheme of things, really didn't matter. I could have immediately gone into how our insurance rates will go up, and we'll have to buy someone a new car. How I know I didn't leave enough milk in the refrigerator for the kids, and my parents will have to go to the store now. But like an angel, I stuck to nice, soothing words, telling him the accident was no big deal.</p> <p>I figured I'd have plenty of time to lay into him later while he was at home and recovering.</p> <p>However, I did have the presence of mind to say to him, "Remember how you made me watch the Steelers game the entire time I was in labor with Sarah?"</p> <p>His eyes slanted and he tried to look at me from his immobile position.</p> <p>"Yeah?"</p> <p>"I have Pride and Prejudice in my bag. Maybe we can watch that tonight."</p> <p>He rolled his eyes and gave a small, painful sigh of defeat.</p> <p>About an hour later, the hospital staff decided that Brad was ready to be checked in to a regular room. With his leg injury, they thought he would probably be there for a couple of days while they monitored him and taught him how to walk on crutches. And knowing that we would be there for a while, I told my dad to go home.</p> <p>"Are you sure?" he said. I could see he was having an internal battle between wanting to be there for me and wanting to get the hell out of that hospital.</p> <p>"I'm fine," I said. "After he gets settled, I'm going to go grab a sandwich downstairs and read my People magazine. We'll be okay. I'll call you and Mom later when I know what's going to happen next."</p> <p>I gave my dad a hug and gathered up my purse and Brad's belongings, which had been put into one of those white and surprisingly durable plastic bags they have at every hospital. I followed the orderlies and made polite conversation as they wheeled Brad into the elevator and then up to the second floor.</p> <p>"Brad?" I said, after he'd been settled into his new bed.</p> <p>"Yeah?"</p> <p>"I'm starving. I think I'm going to go down and grab something to eat. Do you want me to get you anything?"</p> <p>"No...I'm so tired I don't think I could eat anything. But...do you think they have Jell-O? I have the weirdest taste in my mouth."</p> <p>I laughed. "This is a hospital. Their specialty is Jell-O."</p> <p>I walked down the hall to find the room that hospitals have on every floor that contains the coffee, crackers, juice, and Jell-O for its patients and the people who have the unhappy task of sitting around and waiting for people to heal. I found some cherry Jell-O and a spoon, and made my way back to Brad. I awkwardly tried to spoon a few bites into his mouth, carefully trying not to spill it all over the neck brace he was still wearing, until he sighed a little and said, "That's fine. That's all I need. I just want to go to sleep now."</p> <p>"Are you going to be okay for a minute?" I asked. "I'm going to run down and get something to eat, and I need to go to the car and grab my overnight bag. It has my book and everything in it. I'll call your parents while I'm down there because I'm not getting any reception in here."</p> <p>"Okay."</p> <p>And that was the l...</p></p><h2>Sacra Pagina: The Acts Of The Apostles (Volume 5)</h2><p><p><b>Now Available in Paperback!</b><br>The Acts of the Apostles is the second volume in the two-part writing scholars call Luke-Acts.

Habits are powerful. They can lock us into negative behaviors (like snacking and smoking) or train us to act automatically in ways that benefit us (such as putting on a seat belt). Routines quietly undergird large portions of what we do and how we function. Habit formation can speed success in the workplace as well--even in complex areas like leadership. The Leader Habit spotlights 22 essential leadership abilities, breaking them down into a series of small, learnable behaviors. The accompanying 5-minute exercises help you practice each of these new skills until they stick. Drawn from a study of hundreds of leaders across the globe, the book's simple formula focuses on developing one skill at a time: sell the vision, delegate well, innovate often, empower others, overcome resistance, build strategic relationships, focus on customers, listen actively, negotiate effectively, and more. Many of us aspire to great leadership . . . consuming books and training. But unless you intentionally reinforce the right behaviors, results are fleeting.

At its core, leadership is actually a set of concrete skills, such as empowering, selling the vision, building relationships, and influencing.

Rabbinic literature explores the meaning of living life to its fullest, in right relationship with God and humanity. However, many Christians are not aware of rabbinic thought and literature. Indeed, most individuals in the Western world today, regardless of whether they are Christians, atheists, agnostics, secular community leaders, or some other religious and political persuasions, are more knowledgeable of Jesus' ethical teachings in the Sermon the Mount than the Ethics of the Fathers in a Jewish prayer book. The author seeks to introduce the reader to the world of Torah learning. It is within this world that the authentic cultural background of Jesus' teachings in ancient Judaism is revealed. Young uses parts of the New Testament, especially the Sermon on the Mount, as a springboard for probing rabbinic method. The book is an introduction to rabbinic thought and literature and has three main sections in its layout: Introduction to Rabbinic Thought, Introduction to Rabbinic Literature, and Meet the Rabbis, a biographical description of influential Rabbis from Talmudic sources.</p><p><b>Brad H.

Dreyfuss have shaped the cultural landscape of the 20th century. Written in a robust, fresh style, this book offers an inviting mix of professional advice, case studies, and design history along with historical black-and-white photos and the author&#39;s whimsical drawings. In addition, the author&#39;s uncompromising commitment to public service, ethics, and design responsibility makes this masterful guide a timely read for today&#39;s designers.</p><p>Henry S.

Lolo's reply is the same as always: "A boat is no place for a girl." When Nina promises to bait her own hook and remove her own catch, her grandfather finally relents, "just for today." Much to the amusement of the other fishermen in their Filipino village, Lolo shows Nina how to jig the lines, set the hook and pull in a fish hand over hand.

In October 1908, though, no one would have laughed: The Cubs were, without doubt, baseball's greatest team&#x2014;the first dynasty of the 20th century. </p> <p> <i>Crazy '08</i> recounts the 1908 season&#x2014;the year when Peerless Leader Frank Chance's men went toe to toe to toe with John McGraw and Christy Mathewson's New York Giants and Honus Wagner's Pittsburgh Pirates in the greatest pennant race the National League has ever seen. The American League has its own three-cornered pennant fight, and players like Cy Young, Ty Cobb, Walter Johnson, and the egregiously crooked Hal Chase ensured that the junior circuit had its moments. But it was the National League's&#x2014;and the Cubs'&#x2014;year. </p> <p> <i>Crazy '08</i>, however, is not just the exciting story of a great season. It is also about the forces that created modern baseball, and the America that produced it. In 1908, crooked pols run Chicago's First Ward, and gambling magnates control the Yankees. Fans regularly invade the field to do handstands or argue with the umps; others shoot guns from rickety grandstands prone to burning. There are anarchists on the loose and racial killings in the town that made Lincoln. On the flimsiest of pretexts, General Abner Doubleday becomes a symbol of Americanism, and baseball's own anthem, "Take Me Out to the Ballgame," is a hit. </p> <p> Picaresque and dramatic, 1908 is a season in which so many weird and wonderful things happen that it is somehow unsurprising that a hairpiece, a swarm of gnats, a sudden bout of lumbago, and a disaster down in the mines all play a role in its outcome. And sometimes the events are not so wonderful at all. There are several deaths by baseball, and the shadow of corruption creeps closer to the heart of baseball&#x2014;the honesty of the game itself. Simply put, 1908 is the year that baseball grew up. </p> <p> Oh, and it was the last time the Cubs won the World Series. </p> <p> Destined to be as memorable as the season it documents, <i>Crazy '08</i> sets a new standard for what a book about baseball can be. </p></p><p><p>Cait Murphy is the author of <em>Crazy '08: How a Cast of Cranks, Rogues, Boneheads, and Magnates Created the Greatest Year in Baseball History</em> and has worked at <em>Fortune</em>, the <em>Economist</em>, and the <em>Wall Street Journal Asia</em> in Hong Kong. She lives in New York City.</p>*Starred Review* Fans knew they were seeing the end of a marvelous season when they watched the Cubs claim the National League pennant by defeating the New York Giants on October 8, 1908. But with the advantage of historical perspective, Murphy recognizes that the '08 fans actually witnessed baseball's decisive turn toward modernity. In a tale peopled with colorful characters--including the regal Christy Mathewson and the boozy Hal Chase--Murphy unfolds the formative events of this frenetic year. Readers will relish the infamous "Merkle game"--a game apparently won by the Giants, but later declared a tie because of a base-running blunder. Almost as riveting is the season-ending replay of the controversial tie, a replay that so aroused fans that some snuck into the game through the sewers, and many stayed to assault the victorious visitors. A writer of exceptional verve when recounting the heroics of the diamond, Murphy evinces a shrewd intelligence when scanning the cultural forces remaking the world beyond the ballpark. She unravels the malign dynamics behind Ty Cobb's violence against blacks, and she limns the parallels between early-twentieth-century anxieties about immigrant anarchists and twenty-first-century fears of foreign terrorists. A book that will long claim the attention of serious sports enthusiasts. <i>Bryce Christensen</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Few people think of the brain as being susceptible to change in its actual structure, but in fact we can preselect the kind of brain we will have by continually exposing ourselves to rich and varied life experiences. Unlike other organs that eventually wear out with repeated and sustained use, the brain actually improves the more we challenge it. <br><br>Most of us incorporate some kind of physical exercise into our daily lives. We do this to improve our bodies and health and generally make us feel better. Why not do the same for the brain? The more we exercise it, the better it performs and the better we feel. Think of Restak as a personal trainer for your brain&#x2014;he will help you assess your mental strengths and weaknesses, and his entertaining book will set you to thinking about the world and the people around you in a new light, providing you with improved and varied skills and capabilities. From interacting with colleagues to recognizing your own psychological makeup, from understanding the way you see something to why you&#x2019;re looking at it in the first place, from explaining the cause of panic attacks to warding off performance anxiety, this book will tell you the whys and hows of the brain&#x2019;s workings. <br><br>Packed with practical advice and fascinating examples drawn from history, literature, and science, <b>Mozart&#x2019;s Brain and the Fighter Pilot</b> provides twenty-eight informative and realistic steps that we can all take to improve our brainpower.</p><p>Richard Restak, M.D., is a neurologist, neuropsychiatrist, and clinical professor of neurology at George Washington University Medical Center. He is the author of the bestselling book <b>The Brain</b>, a companion to the PBS series of the same name, as well as <b>The Mind</b> and <b>The Brain Has a Mind of Its Own</b>. He lives in Washington, D.C.Chapter 1<br><br><b>Learn as much as possible about how your brain works.</b><br><br>This is the most important factor in getting smart and staying smart. In order to do this, you don't have to become a neurologist or subscribe to scholarly journals on neuroscience (the study of the brain at every operating level ranging from everyday observable behavior to brain processes taking place at the level of chemicals and molecules). Here is a useful summary of the facts you should know.<br><br>The adult human brain weighs about three pounds and consists of about 100 billion nerve cells or neurons along with an even greater number of non-neuronal cells called glia (in Greek, glia means "glue") interspersed among the neurons. The neurons are responsible for the communication of information throughout the brain. Especially important is the brain's outer wrinkled mantle, the cerebral cortex, which gives the brain the appearance of a gnarled walnut. The cerebral cortex contains about 30 billion neurons linked to one another by means of a million billion neuronal connections called synapses.<br><br>As pointed out by Nobel Prize-winning neuroscientist Gerald Edelman, more than 32 million years would be required to count all of the synapses in the human brain at a counting rate of one synapse per second. And if we concentrate on the number of possible neuronal connections (circuits) within the brain, we get an even more astounding number: 10 followed by a million zeros. To put that number into some kind of perspective, consider that the number of particles in the known universe comes to only 10 followed by seventy-nine zeros. Finally, consider that the glia, which exceed the number of neurons by at least a power of 10, are also believed to be capable of communication. If this is true, then the number of possible brain states exceeds even our most extravagant projections.<br><br>Any of the brain's 100 or so billion neurons can potentially communicate with any other via one or more linkages. Indeed, each neuron is no more than two or three degrees of separation from another. Linkages, once formed, are strengthened by repetition. At the behavioral level, this takes the form of habit. Each time you practice a piano piece or a golf swing (presuming you are doing it correctly), your performance improves. This corresponds at the neuronal level to the establishment and facilitation of neuronal circuits.<br><br>The cerebral cortex consists of the outer gray matter of the cerebral hemispheres and the cerebellum, the two structures that contain most of the neurons in the brain. Less than a quarter inch in thickness, this thin rind (cortex in the original Latin means "rind"), includes some 85 percent of all brain tissue. An obvious feature of the cerebral cortex is its highly convoluted surface and wrinkled appearance. This wrinkling serves the purpose of increasing the surface area of this thin outer layer without a corresponding increase in volume and size (similar to wrinkling a handkerchief so that the larger surface area can be contained in the smaller confines of a wallet or small purse).<br><br>While it's true that certain brain areas are specialized (such as the centers for processing sight, sound, touch, and other qualities and properties), the largest portion of the brain, the association cortex, is devoted to establishing networks and thereby linking everything together throughout the brain. As a result of this networking, you don't separately see, hear, taste, smell, and feel your breakfast bagel-you experience it as a unity. It's the association cortex that makes that possible. Figure B, on page 23, shows the association cortex. Notice that it makes up more than 90 percent of the brain. Figure A, on page 22, depicts the other major brain areas along with some of their specialized functions. Notice that the right and left hemispheres are specialized for different functions as depicted in Figure C, on page 24, and discussed in detail later in the book.<br><br>Below the cerebral hemispheres lies a group of nuclei (collections of nerve cells) that organize movement. These nuclei, called the basal ganglia, enable you to do such things as skillfully maneuver your way through heavy traffic while simultaneously rehearsing what you're going to say at the business meeting later in the morning. In computer terms, the cerebral cortex writes the software programs for actions and, after some practice on your part, the basal ganglia take over to run the programs that enable you to carry out the actions. When you learn the tango, for instance, you have to concentrate (i.e., use the cerebral cortex) to plan, learn, and get comfortable with the steps. But after some practice and experience, you're eventually able to tango while thinking of other things because the basal ganglia are operating that system automatically.<br><br>Toward the back of the brain resides the cerebellum, a center involved in movement, balance, and coordination. The last time you watched a gymnast at the top of his or her form you were watching the cerebellum operating at its highest level. But the structure is not just for balance and coordination; it is also involved in the planning activities that precede movement.<br><br>Nevertheless, as we will illustrate throughout this book, the brain can't be considered only in terms of its separate components. Think of it as a unified structure in which each part contributes toward its total functioning. As an example, suppose you suddenly decide you'd like a pizza. That thought is formulated as an action plan by the frontal lobes, which are located just behind your forehead, and results in impulses directed to the cerebellum. Your cerebellum, along with structures from the basal ganglia (sometimes referred to as subcortical motor centers), translates the frontal lobes' action plan into a motor program. First you make a phone call and arrange for the pizza delivery; then you pay the delivery person upon arrival; finally, you sit down, open the box, and reach in for that first slice. Each of these separate motions involves different muscles activated in a different sequence. Or you might use different muscles depending on the circumstances. For instance, if your right elbow is slightly sore from too much tennis, you'll have to eat the pizza with your nondominant left hand. In order to make this switch, your cerebellum formulates a change in the motor program received from the frontal lobes. Indeed, the cerebellum springs into action prior to any perceptible movement on your part. Thus, when your hand approaches the pizza the cerebellum has already predicted and anticipated all of the necessary fine hand and finger movements that will take place over the next minute or so. Such an anticipatory function operates over your entire life span, during which your cerebellum regularly programs hundreds of thousands of action sequences involving every muscle in the body.<br><br>But your cerebellum isn't just a glorified personal trainer that integrates muscles into motor programs. The cerebellum is also integral to activities not involving movement at all, such as when you try to solve a problem, or remember someone's name, or maybe just do nothing more than sit and think. The cerebellum of music conductors, for instance, springs into action when the conductors listen to or read the score of an unfamiliar Bach chorale. Since the conductors are not moving at the time, their cerebellar activity must relate to their listening to and thinking about the music. As a practical application of this research finding that simply listening to or reading a musical score is sufficient for cerebellar activation, consider boosting your own brain circuitry by refining your musical appreciation and knowledge. As Gordon Shaw, a physicist at the University of California at Irvine, puts it, "music is tapping into an inherent structure of the brain." We'll say more about that "tapping" in chapter 23.<br><br>But the findings of cerebellar enhancement are not limited to music. Neuroscientists have known for years that any skilled activity enhances the cerebellum. In addition, we now know that imaging or mentally concentrating on the activities can accomplish a similar result. Of course, that doesn't mean you can become a musician or an athlete by thought alone. You have to undertake the discipline of learning how to play the violin or perfecting your tennis backhand. But once you've made progress in your training, imaging can help activate and sustain the necessary circuits. Extensive two-way connections between cerebellum and frontal cortex make this possible.<br><br>Indeed, thought and movement are integrated via the two-directional interplay between the cerebrum-the enlarged wrinkled structure at the top of the brain-and the cerebellum. Mental agility and physical agility complement rather than act in opposition to each other. Therefore, relegate to the Museum of Outmoded Ideas your stereotypes of "dumb" athletes and physically inactive superpower intellects. In most instances, your typical professional athlete spends many hours mentally rehearsing the moves or plays that bring victory. And most writers and other intellectuals try to put aside some time each day for exercise: they've learned that even a short exercise break clears the head and gets the intellectual juices flowing again.<br><br>And what about the emotional response to such experiences? That's when the limbic system kicks into gear. The limbic system is a shorthand term for the brain structures within and below the cerebrum. Its most important components are the cingulate gyrus in the cerebrum and the hippocampus and amygdala buried below the cerebral hemispheres.<br><br>On the microscopic level, neurons interconnect with one another for the purpose of processing electrical and chemical information. One of the great mysteries of the human brain concerns how these electrical and chemical codes are converted into your desire for that pizza. So far, no one has the solution to the mystery-which is usually referred to as the mind-brain problem. Perhaps nobody will ever solve it, since comparing electrical and chemical events to everyday human decisions is like comparing apples to oranges. When you ordered the pizza, all kinds of interesting activities were going on within your brain-the biological structure one neuroscientist once compared to "an enchanted loom." But how to relate those electrical and chemical changes that take place when you crave a pizza? Nobody has a clue.<br><br>Many highly branched processes referred to as dendrites (from the Greek word for "tree") convey incoming information from one neuron to another. (Arborization is the term used to convey the treelike appearance and structure of those neurons and their connections. When nerve tissue is looked at through a microscope, the overlapping of the processes of the many neurons looks like the branches of trees.) Each neuron receives information from as many as one thousand other neurons by way of contact on one of its dendrites. The mechanism for transporting outgoing information to another cell involves the axon, a single process that extends outward for varying lengths until reaching its end point, the nerve terminal. By convention, two communicating neurons are referred to as presynaptic (the message carrier) and postsynaptic (the message receiver), with any two communicating cells separated from each other by a tiny space, the synapse.<br><br>At the synapse, communication changes from an electrical impulse to a chemical one. Neurotransmitters (chemical messengers) are released from the messenger cell and diffuse across the synapse to lock onto a specialized receptor. Advances over the past three decades in our knowledge about the brain's microscopic and chemical organization have made possible successful treatments for psychiatric illnesses like depression and anxiety. The drugs work by altering the balance of neurotransmitters within the synapse. But the same alteration can be brought about by changes in attitude and behavior. We will say more about this in later chapters.</p><h2>Breaking the Islam Code: Understanding the Soul Questions of Every Muslim</h2><p><p>World events won&#x2019;t let North Americans ignore Muslims anymore.

It wasn't exactly thriving, but it was still afloat and becoming more popular every day. The walls were painted a soft blue. She'd done that herself. Every cupboard, every placement of the display cases, every single thing from the lettering to the floor-she'd done it. The dusty old, torn-up space had been renovated by her. It was now cozy and inviting with the tables and chairs. She loved the way the bakery smelled. Every single morning when she got up to bake, she looked forward to the day. Back "home" she detested her very existence.<br><br>"This is home, Robert. I love it here and I'm stayin'. It's more home to me than that place ever was." She kept her voice quiet. Low. She was used to being silent. She didn't argue, nor did she like arguments. She especially didn't like Robert Lenoux coming to her hard-won business and insisting she return. "In any case, I thought you were travelin', going to the Borneo rain forest."<br><br>She knew all about Robert, although she'd never actually met him until he'd walked into her bake shop. He had been sent away in disgrace, had served a brief jail stint, but got out of a real sentence from the law by turning evidence against his friends. Murderers. He'd participated in beating and robbing the elderly in their homes, in raping exotic dancers. He had committed countless crimes against his lair, and looking at him, she knew he didn't care about anyone but himself. Especially women.<br><br>"Fuck that," Robert spat. "I'm not goin' to be sent away from my home by some outsider who thinks he can order me around. The entire point of goin' to Borneo is to bring home a woman. You'll do just fine. I don' care that you aren' a shifter."<br><br>Her stomach lurched and then tied into knots. She took a deep calming breath. She'd left that world behind. She wasn't about to allow a bad-tempered, evil male leopard, one who no doubt didn't mind hitting a woman, into her life.<br><br>"The answer is no. I am never goin' back there."<br><br>"You have a duty to the rest of us." Robert reached out, settled hard fingers around her upper arm and yanked her close to him.<br><br>Alarm skittered down her spine. She took a step back but his fingers only tightened into an iron band. "Let go of me, Robert. Now." She hissed the word, letting him see she wouldn't stand for being pushed around by him. By anyone. Not ever again. "I want you to leave. This is my shop and I'm askin' you politely to leave."<br><br>The bell over the bakery door tinkled merrily, at odds with the tension in the room. Both turned their heads toward the sound. Evangeline's breath caught in her throat. She'd grown up around dangerous men. Criminals. Horrible, cunning, viciously cruel men. She knew criminals. She had a radar for them. No one needed radar to know without a single doubt that the man walking through the door of her bakery was dangerous. Terrifyingly so.<br><br>He glanced around her beautiful little shop and saw every single detail, yet he didn't see it because there could be no appreciation. None. There was no emotion on his face or in his flat, cold, dead eyes. Beautiful eyes. Gorgeous eyes. A shocking blue. Like the blue ice of a glacier. His lashes were long and as black as night, framing those icy blue eyes. But there was not a single hint of emotion, not even when his gaze settled on Robert's hand on her arm. Absolutely nothing. He walked. He breathed. He probably killed people. But if he did, he did it with absolutely no emotion. And he'd heard them arguing. She could tell by the way he looked at Robert's fingers wrapped around her.<br><br>He was very tall, ruggedly built, all roped muscle, and he looked absolutely invincible. She was used to men with muscle, but he was a fighter, through and through. The way he moved-the control, the containment, smooth, fluid, easy, as if he glided or flowed across the floor rather than walked. He did that in absolute silence too, as if his very expensive Italian leather shoes didn't actually touch the floor.<br><br>His suit looked as if it had cost as much as the renovations on the bakery space and been custom made for him-which it probably had been. His icy gaze remained on Robert's fingers digging into her bicep. She'd all but forgotten he was gripping her so hard until fear sent a chill arrowing through her.<br><br>Robert must have felt it too. He was leopard. A shifter. She knew from gossip he had a nasty temper and was as strong as an ox. Like most shifters, he didn't fear much. His leopard would shred an enemy in seconds if he were threatened. Still, he let her go and stepped back away from her. Away from the newcomer. Subtly putting her between them.<br><br>"Can I help you?" Evangeline asked. Her voice sounded different, even to her. Her accent was deeper, a soft sultry lure she hadn't meant to throw, but really? Every single cell in her body was aware of him. The bayou came out in her voice more than it ever had before, and it sounded like an invitation to spend the night floating down a lazy canal together under a starlit night.<br><br>She wasn't the type of woman to flirt with a man, let alone speak to him in a voice like that. She knew better. She knew danger when she saw it, but she came alive the moment he entered her bakery. Her body had been asleep but now it was wide awake and very aware of every inch of the Iceman. She'd already nicknamed him and thought of him as her Iceman, even if it was just in her fantasies.<br><br>His eyes focused on her. He looked at her through a blue glacier without once blinking. "Coffee. Black. A piece of your cinnamon cake."<br><br>His voice was deep. Dark. As cold as his eyes. As cold as Siberia-the dead of winter in Siberia. At the same time, it was low and sensual. She couldn't stop the little shiver that ran through her body at the sound of it. Heat pooled low and wicked, and something wild and feral deep inside her stirred. She had an unexpected urge to take all of that molten heat spreading through her and see if she could unthaw the Iceman's cold.<br><br>He spoke with a heavy Italian accent. For some reason that shocked her. She didn't expect Italian. More . . . Russian. Maybe because she associated him with Siberia. She couldn't get that out of her mind. To her, he would always be her Russian Iceman.<br><br>Evangeline nodded and turned away from his male potency. He was definitely out of her league. Out of her world. Her universe. This was not a man any sane person would want in their life. Her hands trembled as she poured the coffee-her special all-natural brew customers raved about. The pieces of the cinnamon cake were generous and she arranged one on one of the oblong-shaped plates with her fancy gold logo on it. The E for Evangeline running through the center of it.<br><br>He took it without a word. He simply nodded at her, those icy blue eyes never lighting up, never registering life in them at all. No emotion. No nothing. He certainly wasn't feeling the electrical attraction she was. He turned away and moved across the room. He pulled a chair around so that his back would be to the wall facing the plate-glass entry. He dragged a small table in front of him, put the coffee and the plate on the table and then went to the small stand where the napkins and silverware were.<br><br>Evangeline took a deep breath and let it out. She couldn't-wouldn't-stare at him. Robert stepped close again, leaning into her, so that his breath puffed into her ear, an intrusion that annoyed her. She'd been so aware of the Iceman that she'd all but forgotten Robert.<br><br>"We aren' finished, Evangeline. I'm takin' you back with me."<br><br>"I asked you to leave," she said equally as quiet. "And please don' come back."<br><br>Robert hissed at her, his eyes going sheer cat, his temper rising at her defiance. She stood her ground, her heart suddenly pounding. She didn't want to be afraid of him, but it was impossible with him standing so close, scowling fiercely at her. He was deliberately trying to intimidate her. She barely knew him, only what her friend Saria Boudreux-now Donovan-had told her about him, and none of it was good. Saria knew everyone, and Robert Lenoux was from one of the seven shifter families leasing thousands of acres in the swamp.<br><br>Robert stepped even closer, deliberately towering over her smaller figure. Once again his fingers bit into her arm, this time hard enough to leave bruises. There was the softest of rustlings and they both turned to see the Iceman standing a few feet from them, one great big fist encased in a very expensive leather glove, shoving a napkin into the trash can. His eyes were on Robert's face and they were colder than ever. The blue in them appeared to be glowing, a flame beneath all that ice.<br><br>Evangeline's breath caught in her lungs and everything in her stilled. He was leopard. A shifter. It seemed impossible there in San Antonio, a place far from where she grew up. Shifters were rare and to find one in a city . . . Impossible, but there was no mistaking those eyes. Exotic. Terrifying. Totally focused on Robert.<br><br>"Let. Her. Go." Each word was soft. Spoken in a low tone. Ice dripped from the voice. The Iceman didn't look at Evangeline, his entire focus on the man hurting her.<br><br>Robert couldn't fail to see those eyes, read death in them and know what the Iceman was. He hissed a curse word, let go of Evangeline, turned and stormed out, slamming the door. The Iceman turned back toward his table.<br><br>"Thank you," Evangeline said softly. Meaning it. She'd left all that behind her and she never wanted to go back. It didn't matter that this man clearly was a criminal. Or far more dangerous than Robert could ever be. Or that Robert ran like a rabbit from him when his leopard had to have been raking and clawing for a fight. He'd stepped in when he didn't have to, and she was grateful. He deserved to know it.<br><br>The Iceman turned slightly, looking at her over one broad shoulder. His glacier-blue eyes swept over her and then he nodded slightly before turning away.<br><br>Evangeline let out her breath slowly and turned back to straightening the baked goods in the case. She got up at three A.M. every morning and baked the day's goods so they were fresh. She couldn't afford to hire anyone else to work in her shop, so she did it all. The baking, the coffee, the dishes, the cleaning of the shop, all of it, and she took pride in her work. She was getting by, managing to pay the bills each month, and that meant she could keep her independence. She was determined to make it on her own.<br><br>She snuck another quick look at her Iceman. He wasn't paying her the slightest bit of attention. Not. At. All. She knew she was easy on the eyes. Since coming to San Antonio, men had flirted outrageously with her. She had no idea what to do with their attention, nor did she want it, but she'd come to realize all the things Saria had tried to convince her about her looks might actually be true.<br><br>She wasn't quite five foot four, so she didn't have those long legs that attracted men, but she had generous curves and a small waist to emphasize them. Her hair was long and very dark, her eyes a true green, like emeralds, a startling color surrounded by long, thick, black lashes. She had great skin, a luscious mouth and a small, straight nose. All in all, she wasn't hard to look at. But he wasn't looking.<br><br>Fortunately, so she didn't make a complete fool of herself, customers began to trickle in. She knew when he got up and left that he didn't look back.<br><br>Over the next week, her Iceman came in three more times. He tried something different each time by pointing or jerking his chin, not speaking. She noticed he preferred things with cinnamon and he liked apples. He always took his coffee black and all three times he indicated he wanted a refill. Each time he came in he rearranged her tables so he could sit with his back against the wall. After the third time, she moved the table herself and left it there permanently for him. He didn't acknowledge that she'd done it, and in a way she was glad. She needed the business, but she didn't want a relationship with him.<br><br>She'd thought with time he would become less scary, less intimidating, but she was wrong. He was more so. An aura of danger clung to him like a second skin. He never laughed. He never smiled. He barely acknowledged her, yet he was aware of everything, every movement, in her shop and on the street. She was certain he was armed to the teeth and sometimes she was afraid the few cops who frequented her shop would come in at the same time and there would be a shoot-out or something equally as awful.<br><br>Two months passed and he came in three times a week, sometimes four, but he never spoke beyond placing his order. She found herself watching for him. Smiling at him when he came in. He never smiled back, but he did stay longer. At least a half an hour longer than he had before.<br><br>A few others dressed in Italian suits came in over the third month, never at the same time as her Iceman, but she knew he'd sent them her way. Business seemed to pick up even more after that, as if seeing people in her shop brought in even more customers. That meant she had to work harder, baking more goods, but she didn't mind; she was finally making it.<br><br>She'd all but forgotten Robert. He was waiting for her to open on a Thursday morning, a day her Iceman rarely came in. That told her Robert had been watching the store, probably looking for a pattern. Her heart stuttered when she saw him come through the door. He casually reached over and turned her sign from open to closed.</p><h2>The Education of Will: Healing a Dog, Facing My Fears, Reclaiming My Life</h2><p>Bestselling author and internationally renowned animal psychologist and dog trainer Patricia McConnell &#x201c;gives a voice to those who can&#x2019;t speak in words and provides hope for fearful animals everywhere&#x201d; (Temple Grandin) in this powerful and uplifting memoir about healing.<br><br>World-renowned as a source of science and soul, Patricia McConnell combines brilliant insights into canine behavior with heartwarming stories of her own dogs and their life on the farm.

He was eight weeks old when I met him, sitting on the grass at his breeder&#x2019;s, with the sheep in the lambing shed bawling to their babies and the crickets buzzing in the woods behind the farmhouse. I didn&#x2019;t need another dog. I already had three, and I wasn&#x2019;t looking for a puppy.<br> <br>I was busy. Busy seeing clients whose pets had serious behavior problems, teaching at the University of Wisconsin, cohosting a radio show, giving speeches on canine behavior, writing books, and running a dog-training business. I didn&#x2019;t need more to do.<br> <br>But I had heard of a litter that was closely related to my once-in-a-lifetime dog, Cool Hand Luke. Luke had not only changed my life, he might have saved it, in a made-for-television moment when I came close to being horribly hurt and he could have died. I&#x2019;d been pinned in a corner of a horse stall by a Scottish Blackface ewe who had just had a lamb and perceived me as a hungry wolf intent on killing her newborn. When she ducked her head and charged me the first time, I dodged to the right and laughed it off. Then she charged again and just missed me. Her head smashed into the barn wall so hard that a confetti of paint flakes fell from the ceiling. She charged once more and I retreated to a corner, looking around for a piece of wood, a bucket, anything I could use to protect myself.<br> <br>We don&#x2019;t go through life aware of our own fragility until we have nothing but our own bodies to protect ourselves. No horns. No thick skin and fur. No bristles or claws. Useless little teeth. Put us up against an animal with a built-in security system and we come up short. I&#x2019;d spent years as an applied animal behaviorist dealing with aggressive dogs. I was used to snarling canines of all kinds who would have bitten me if I&#x2019;d made the wrong move. But I hadn&#x2019;t expected to be trapped in the corner of a barn by a crazed ewe.<br> <br>Crystal the ewe charged again and grazed my thigh. She was known for her bad temper, but she was a sheep, not a two-thousand-pound bull or a muscled-up dog threatening to put me in the hospital. But my irritation began to morph into fear. I couldn&#x2019;t seem to get out of the corner and out of the pen. I was alone on the farm, and if I were badly injured, I wouldn&#x2019;t be missed for days.<br> <br>That&#x2019;s when I heard it: thwap! Luke&#x2019;s paws hit the top of the four-foot stall as he scrambled over the pen like a military dog on maneuvers and hit the ground between Crystal and me. As she turned her attention to him, I scrambled toward the gate. Crystal tucked her head down so far that her chin was tucked under her chest, exposing only her two-inch-thick skull and curved horns. She went for Luke. He charged back, biting at her skull to keep her at bay while I made it out of the gate. After two more charges, Luke made his own escape. A thin stream of blood trickled from his mouth. Two of his front teeth had been broken off.<br> <br>It is one thing to love a dog, to love him so much that sometimes you ache just talking about him. It is another thing altogether to know that he risked his life to save you from serious injury. But Luke was more than the star of this one dramatic moment; he was one of those old souls whose love of life leaves you glowing in its presence. I once wrote about Luke: &#x201c;I imagine his death as if all the oxygen is sucked out of the air, and I am expected to live without it.&#x201d; Of course he died, and of course I didn&#x2019;t&#x2014;but it took me years to stop grieving his untimely death from kidney failure when he was only twelve years old.<br> <br>That was why the prospect of bringing home his nephew two years later was so seductive, despite having a house full of other dogs. All the dogs in Luke&#x2019;s line are famous for their noble dispositions; I had high hopes that this litter would have a pup with some of Luke&#x2019;s personality. Intellectually, I knew full well that every dog is unique, and dogs like Luke are hard to find. But still, how could I pass up the chance that one of the pups of the litter would replicate some of Luke&#x2019;s brilliance?<br> <br>When I arrived to evaluate the litter, I pretended, mostly to myself, that I was making a careful and considered choice. The puppies tussled on the ground, interrupting their play only to leap after butterflies, sniff my jeans, or lick my face with velveteen tongues. I focused on the two male pups, since I had three females at home already. One male was a big, flashy boy with a wide white collar of fur, the other a bit plainer. I couldn&#x2019;t decide between them.<br> <br>The breeder allowed to me to take them both home for a three-day trial period. It was a win/win&#x2014;the pups would be exposed to a new environment at an important age, and I would see how they got along with my other dogs. After a few days, I could decide if one of them was right for me.<br> <br>When I got home, the boys tumbled out of the crate as if out of a clown car. In turn, they met my three other dogs, each of whom performed a leading role at the farm. Tulip, the elderly Great Pyrenees whose radiance of white fur charmed everyone she met, was struggling with irritable bowel syndrome and a progressive neuromuscular disease. She&#x2019;d been in the critical care unit at the local vet school three times that year. After each incident, she recovered and went back to being the farm&#x2019;s jokester, a cross between an oversize seal pup and a benevolent polar bear. For twelve years she had multitasked as the farm&#x2019;s protector and stand-up comedian. I felt I owed her anything I could do to keep her comfortable.<br> <br>Pippy Tay, a fifteen-year-old border collie, had always been a paragon of health. For years, she was Watson to my Sherlock, assisting me in teasing out the reasons why so many of my clients&#x2019; dogs were aggressive to members of their own species. Over the years I&#x2019;d seen at least a hundred dogs standing stiff-legged and snarling while Pippy bowed and curtsied a safe distance away. Within minutes, the visiting dog would melt like ice cream in the sun, and soon they would be playing, while my clients&#x2019; eyes filled with tears of happiness. But Pippy was losing her eyesight and hearing and had long since been retired. I was thrilled she had done so well for so long; I had never counted on her living to the ripe old age of fifteen. Like Tulip, she now needed a lot of care.<br> <br>My third dog, Lassie, a twelve-year-old border collie, was the baby of the group. Vital and energetic, my go-to dog on sheep and still as playful as a puppy, Lassie nonetheless suffered from chronic bladder infections that belied her youthful looks. We spent untold hours with veterinarians trying to figure out what was wrong.<br> <br>You might say that this was not an ideal time to get a puppy. You would be right. I calculated that I had been bringing my dogs to the vet 2.4 times a week for almost half a year. You know it&#x2019;s bad when you take the time to figure that out. With a decimal.<br> <br>Did I really have the energy to raise a puppy? To be on guard at all times, to take the pup outside every ten minutes, and to gently remove the shoes, the remote control, or the pillow from its mouth? I had wanted a young dog for several years but had decided to wait until Pippy died. But even in old age, Pippy was thrilled when puppies visited, so I began to rethink my plan. Besides, I needed something healthy and joyful to make me laugh, to remind me that there was more to life than a slow spiral toward death.<br> <br>Both pups settled into the farm quickly enough, following the tracks of chipmunks behind the house, playing with toys on the threadbare Oriental rug in the living room. But one of them followed me everywhere and seemed to care deeply about what I was doing and where I was going. His brother was better-looking but a bit more independent. Every time I gazed down at the plain one, he was looking up at me with soft, radiant eyes.<br> <br>What is it about eyes that convey so much information but whose qualities seem beyond language? We have so few words to describe the depth of spirit and emotion conveyed by eyes that they all seem a bit trite. But it was his eyes that hooked me. I&#x2019;d look down at this black-and-white fluff ball, and he&#x2019;d gaze at me, his eyes looking deep into mine. Imploringly, as if always asking me a question. I didn&#x2019;t know what it was, but somehow it seemed imperative that I find the answer. I knew by the end of the first day that I couldn&#x2019;t let him go. I named him Will.<br> <br>� � � � �<br> <br>That night, Will and I cuddled together on the living room floor, his little puppy body curled up on my stomach while the three girls encircled us. I stroked their bellies and scratched their ears and murmured to them that life was good, and no matter what happened next, love and determination would see us through.</p><h2>Mixing Essential Oils for Magic: Aromatic Alchemy for Personal Blends</h2><p><p><strong>The Ultimate Guide to Mixing, Matching, and Making Essential Oils</strong></p> <p>Choose the best essential oils for your creative and magical mixing with this straightforward, hands-on guide.
